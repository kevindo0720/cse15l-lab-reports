In the Western experience with evil, we choose repeatedly to put our faith in law and the legal culture to redeem ourselves from sin. Over and over again, we find states indulging in total war, terror, genocide, and the mass killing of their own people, and then turning to the legal culture in the hope that they can atone for the iniquity and live once again as a civilized nation. This view—that the law shall make us clean—should give us pause. Faith in the law has not been an unqualified virtue in the Christian West. One might expect individuals influenced by Jesus’s Sermon on the Mount to turn first to love and charity as the means of atonement. But nations—organized, organic societies—must take a different path. A nation must proceed collectively to find redemption.
I write in this chapter of religious ideas and their value in understanding our legal experience. This, admittedly, is an unusual take in our rigorously secular academic world. The American university world has distanced itself from the sensibilities of ordinary Americans who take the Bible seriously as a source of wisdom and who live their lives with devotion to values of faith and redemption. In this interpretation of law as the path to national redemption, I seek to find a middle way between Jewish and Christian thinking. There is no doubt that the nations whose struggles I describe—France, Germany, and the United States—think of themselves as Christian nations. Yet, the very idea of redemption of the entire nation through law resonates more with the older tradition of the Jewish national mission under the Torah revealed at Mount Sinai. My account seeks to unite the divergent strains of all religions that trace their roots to the original idea in Exodus of a nation living under God and under law.
To understand the phenomenon of communal redemption, we must turn to the Bible as our source. The model of the Hebrews’ deliverance from servitude and their ensuing acceptance of God’s law at Mount Sinai have repeatedly appealed to dominant powers of the West and often to opposite sides of the same conflict. In the rhetoric of the abolitionists, slavery in the United States made the country into “a House of Bondage.” Both blacks and whites identified with the same story of liberation from this domain of oppression. Nat Turner thought he was recreating the biblical story when he led a slave revolt in 1831. The slaves whom Harriet Tubman led to freedom in the North called her Moses. Abraham Lincoln readily saw himself in the image of Moses leading his people out of bondage into the realm of freedom.
The Hebrews fled Egypt in order, eventually, to accept the law revealed at Mount Sinai: delivery from servitude requires more than violent revolt. The message of Exodus is not simply liberation from slavery but the domesticating of violent sensibilities under the rule of law. Jews celebrate this submission to God’s law in the holiday of Shevuot, which commemorates the revelation of the Torah at Mount Sinai and is celebrated fifty days after the night of the Exodus. Christians have reinterpreted this event as the descent of the Holy Spirit, celebrated in the analogous spring holiday of Pentecost.
The idea that freedom exists only under law is often understood as a Central European or German approach to the individual in society. Americans tend to subscribe rather to the myth of a Lockian state of nature, where individuals exist prior to the organization of society under a social contract. The Declaration of Independence relies heavily on the principle that the “consent of the governed” is indispensable to the legitimacy of government. Yet, in actual American practice, the law—particularly constitutional law—serves the same function of sanctifying the social order as it does in the European experience. Before turning to the details of the American appeal to law after the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865, let us examine first two significant European efforts to domesticate tendencies toward violence under the rule of law.


Redemption by Law in 
France and Germany

Think first about the way in which the French sought repose from post-revolutionary terror in their Code civil. The country passed through fifteen years of regicide, terror, and mass executions. Amidst voices clamoring for stability and security, Napoleon staged his coup d’état in late 1799. High on his agenda was revamping the legal system. In 1804, he charged a group of lawyers with the task of drafting a new civil code in language accessible to ordinary people. The committee produced the elegant Code civil, now a mainstay of French culture and a model for civil codification all over the world. The language is so refined that the novelist Henri Stendhal reportedly reviewed the style of ten code provisions every night before retiring. Today, when the Francophones in Quebec preach the distinctiveness of their culture, they never fail to mention their Code civil, modeled after Napoleon’s effort to use the law as the means of restoring civilized order to France.
The Code civil has proved to be remarkably durable in French culture. Constitutions have come and gone and the French have endured recurrent changes of regime, including communes, dictatorships, and five distinct republics. Yet, through all this, the civil code has survived. It is the cultural monument that unites the French across history.
In its substantive content, the Code civil is strongly identified with the achievements of the 1789 Revolution against the ancien regime. The code sweeps away the vestiges of feudal influence in the law of property and in the law of evidence and proclaims a liberal legal order. The end of feudalism in the law of property meant that a single concept of ownership would replace the ancient system of embedded estates. The implication was that all land would be freely alienable, without being burdened by the residual control of lords higher in the feudal chain. The code thus provides the legal foundation for a market economy. The end of feudalism in the field of evidence means that the testimony of a nobleman is no longer worth more than the oath of a peasant. Thus the code institutionalizes the égalité of all citizens, as promised in the slogan of the Revolution.
Standing for these liberal values, incorporating the messages of revolution, and surviving all changes of political regimes, the Code civil functions like a constitution for the French. It is the bedrock of the legal culture. In their code, the French have found an enduring symbol of the rule of law, a conviction that the language, concepts, and rules of the legal order can hold back the impulses toward violence, terror, and reciprocal vengeance. Faith in the code has redeemed the nation from the nightmare of the guillotine.
The metaphor of redemption should not pass our lips lightly. In its original meaning, it has legal connotations; something on loan gets returned to its owner. The older Jewish law of homicide relied on the metaphor of the Goel haDam, “the redeemer of blood” to refer to the victim’s next-of-kin who, under certain circumstances, could pursue the murderer and kill him. David Daube has interpreted this practice against the background assumption that at the time of a natural death, the life force—symbolized by blood—always returns to God.1 If the death occurs at the hand of another, the manslayer unnaturally acquires control over the victim’s “blood.” The Goel haDam, the redeemer-of-blood, executes the manslayer in order to release the victim’s blood, thus enabling it to return to its divine source. The notion that our life force belongs to God accounts for the views of virtually all secular liberal systems that no one can validly consent to his or her own killing at the hand of another.
It is tempting to extend this idea and to think of all humanity as enjoying a temporary privilege of life on earth. God somehow will redeem all of us at the end of history. In fact, the Jewish view, as it has evolved and matured, seems to have avoided this universalization of the idea that individual life stems from God. As the idea developed, the agent of redemption would be the Messiah, who would bring a reign of peace and harmony to life on earth. The redemption occurs in life as we know it. Orthodox Jewish culture takes the observance of God’s commandments, living under the rule of revealed law as interpreted by the rabbis, as the way to hasten the Messiah’s reign of harmony and order. The law, then, becomes the path toward redemption. Until the Prince of Peace comes to “fulfill the law,” or until the Apocalypse at the end of days, the secular law of the nation is the only means we have to work toward the perfection of life on earth.
The place of “blood” in the religious tradition of redemption proves to be subtle and problematic. There are some strains in the Jewish tradition that link the letting of blood with returning the soul to God. The “redeemer of blood” reminds us of that connection, as does the popular view that the founding of Israel stood in some kind of organic relationship with the Holocaust. The connection between blood and salvation becomes much stronger, however, in the Christian interpretation of its Jewish legacy. The theme of blood spilling from the body becomes powerful in the crucifixion and reaches its apotheosis in the faith that a great battle, an Apocalypse, must precede the Second Coming of the Messiah. The spilling of blood in a great battle is understood instinctively as the suffering that must precede redemption. As John Brown was led to the gallows on the eve of the Civil War, having unsuccessfully sought to stimulate a slave revolt, he handed one of his guards a note, “I John Brown am now quite certain that the crimes of this guilty land will never be purged away but with blood.”2
But blood alone does not save a nation from its sins. The argument here is that indulgence in evil—slavery, mass killing, persecution—must first issue in the suffering of the people. To overcome their sense of self-inflicted brutality, they turn to the law as the path of secular redemption. They search for stability after having succumbed to their baser instincts. The law provides a source of hope that the civil order can resist the recurrent slippage into violence and brutality. The important point is that the rule of law—not charity, not prayer, not animal sacrifice—should provide the means of secular redemption.
For nations as a whole to seek redemption, they must find a discipline that operates on them as a group, as a community. Individual acts of devotion will not suffice. Needed is the discipline represented by the law—the expression of communal cooperation, par excellence. The compromises and obligations of life under the law hardly makes sense to individuals standing alone, preoccupied by their own values and their own needs. The law redeems not the individual but the community or the nation as a whole.3
This view of the relationship between law and redemption finds expression in the Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament. It continues to inspire the law-based thinking of Judaism, Islam, the Catholic Church, and some Protestant theologians. The law given at Sinai, the law embedded in the covenant, is not the expression of individual aspiration but only of collective obligation. Seeking redemption or salvation through the church or through faith provides a way of cleansing ourselves of sin and, as it were, perfecting our individual creation.
Legal cultures, too, must seek to perfect themselves. They cannot exist simply as the product of will. When legal cultures lose sight of their natural end of bringing a reign of justice and harmony to human affairs, they decline into corruption and the arbitrariness of power. The German philosopher Gustav Radbruch defined the ideal of Law as the practice of establishing rules in the pursuit of justice.4 Communal life seeks, through law, to perfect itself. This secular idea parallels the eschatological aim of perfecting the creation of the world under God’s reign.
Seeking redemption under the law cannot simply be a desire for one’s parochial values to triumph in the courts. It matters which values are in play. And it matters how these values are debated in the legal culture. Debate about legal issues must be open and robust, and the very process of legal argument must communicate respect for the opposition. At the end of a legal argument, both sides must have the sense that they have been listened to, and that the dignity of the losing party is affirmed in the process of decision. Here, as well, we have much to learn from the model provided by the Jewish tradition of Talmudic debate. When a rabbi questioned how two of the greatest sages, Rabbis Hillel and Shammai, could persistently disagree, the response was: “These and these are the words of the living God.” Although Rabbi Hillel’s views are generally followed, Rabbi Shammai is treated, in defeat, with the greatest respect.
It is not surprising that when the established authority’s respect for the political opposition is debased, the legal culture invariably suffers. This is most noticeably clear in dictatorial societies where legal debate is reduced to little more than efforts to placate the powers that be. Although the National Socialists purported to rely on legal forms and administrative regularity, their contempt for free and mutually respectful discourse led to a corruption of the legal culture. The Nazis’ conception of law fluctuated between two unpalatable extremes. Sometimes the slogan was that law was what Hitler wanted and commanded (Recht is das, was der Führer will). At other times, utility to the German people was the ultimate source of legitimacy (Recht is das, was dem Volke nutzt).5 The National Socialist Party’s manipulation of these slogans and their observance of legal forms served only to bring the culture to a deeper level of corruption.
It is an extraordinary feature of postwar German culture that a new generation of jurists managed to save, to redeem, their concept of law from its racist and Nazi associations. In the wake of their unforgettable crimes against humanity, the West Germans, too, sought redemption in the rule of law, in the Rechtsstaat that they have cultivated along with economic prosperity. Living by the law, and seeking justice within the law, redeems the humanistic side of German culture. It has suppressed the romantic will to break all restraints for the sake of glory in power.
The Germans, too, have a civil code that has united them, since 1900, through the transitions from Bismarck, to Weimar, to the Third Reich, to the present. Yet, under the National Socialists, the code, which contains the provisions on family law, became tainted with notions of racial purity. Jews and Aryans could not marry. Of course, this stain disappeared in the postwar reform, but the memory remains of a corrupted civil code. Not surprisingly, then, Germans have sought redemption by promoting both a new constitution, enacted in 1949, and the rule of law in a united Europe. More than any country seeking redemption under law, the Germans identified their new constitution, the Grundgesetz, as the focal point of state authority. The sanctity of the constitution—and not the personal head of state—became the interest protected under the reformed law of treason. When West Germans felt their infant postwar republic endangered by Communist subversion, they appointed an agency to protect the integrity of the government. The announced aim of the agency was to protect the constitution (Verfassungsschutz).
The preamble of this charter, called the Basic Law (Grundgesetz), repeatedly reminds Germans of the imperative to atone for the sins of the past:

Conscious of its responsibility before God and humanity, possessed of the will to serve the peace of the world as an equal member of a United Europe, the German nation [Volk] commits itself, by virtue of its inherent constitution-making authority, to the following Basic Law.6

No other constitution, so far as I know, stresses its sense of “responsibility” and declares as one of its primary purposes “to serve the peace of the world.” These gestures recall the descent of the German nation into the evils of aggressive war and crimes against humanity.
The first article of the Basic Law invokes the humanistic Kantian underpinnings of German culture: “Human dignity is inviolable. All state power is obligated to protect it and respect it.” This provision provides the backdrop for interpreting all the basic rights guaranteed under the constitution. The protection of human dignity is the fundamental value suffusing the entire legal order. The highest virtue of the postwar German constitutional order, then, was precisely the greatest casualty of the Nazi regime. The path to redemption lay in reclaiming the liberal and humanistic values most systematically violated in their darkest hour. The point is carried forward in the second article: “Everyone has the right to flourishing of his or her personality. . . . Everyone has the right to life.”
These are provisions that enabled Germans to redefine their identities. They would no longer be the people devoted to the Volk above all. They would become the nation of human dignity that served the cause of human flourishing and the sanctity of human life. For the postwar Germans, then, the law, and particularly the Basic Law became the means for suppressing evil impulses and returning to the promises of an earlier national self. This is what redemption means in a secular legal world.
The redemptive impulse leads national courts to place an emphasis on values that resonate against past sins. The German Constitutional Court has made a number of controversial decisions that make sense primarily as efforts to resolve the burden of memory. The court decided to uphold a law abolishing the twenty-year statute of limitations for concentration camp murders.7 It invoked the constitutional “right to life” to strike down a liberal abortion law that permitted abortion on demand in the first trimester.8 And, more recently, the court rejected an East German statutory justification for border guards who shot at their own citizens trying to flee the country for the West.9 All of these decisions brought to the fore fundamental values of protecting life and punishing those with contempt for life. Yet, the particular German emphasis on these values would probably not appeal in the same measure to other European courts.
The Germans themselves have coined a unique, hard-to-translate phrase to describe the controversies that have driven their system of justice for the last fifty years. They call it Bewältigung der Vergangenheit—“overcoming” or “coming to grips with” the past. Settling accounts with the past provides a critical perspective on the process of redemption from evil. We cannot avoid the past, for we are all prisoners of it. In real life, we cannot reenact the forty years of wandering in the desert that the Hebrews had to endure before they could shake off their ingrained ways and a new generation could seek redemption under the law. In the world of practical politics, we must act now, and criminal punishment often provides the mechanism for distancing ourselves from the past so that we can start anew.


Civil War as the Path 
to Redemption

As France and Germany had their experiences of seeking redemption after reigns of terror, Americans, too, indulged in the mammoth bloodletting on the killing fields of the Civil War. When Lincoln sought to resupply Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor, and General Beauregard chose in response to fire on the federal fort, the long-simmering feud between North and South bled into brothers’ killing each other at close range. They fired their canons on Fort Sumter, they fixed their bayonets at Little Round Top, they lobbed shells onto Vicksburg until troops could seize the forts reigning over the Mississippi, they burned down Atlanta, and under William Tecumseh Sherman they scorched the earth on their march to the sea. The blue and the gray fell everywhere. And they were not sure why. They only had abstract ideas in their heads—some died for the Union, others for their separate nation. Over six hundred thousand lives stained the ground, more than all the former and subsequent American wars put together.
Having barely won reelection midway in this slaughter, Abraham Lincoln could only say of the reign of terror, “Woe unto the world because of offences!” We had descended into the bloodiest war of our history without clear purposes or any understanding of how it might end. “For it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!” The self-inflicted pogrom is seen as a “woe” and a “scourge” inflicted for the terrible “offence” of slavery. Lincoln’s second inaugural address prayed for redemption. The nation had bled its sins onto its own soil and craved a rebirth of American civilization.
The survivors turned to law. One year into the war, after a string of Union defeats, Lincoln learned that the old Union could not possibly survive. “A new one had to be embraced.”10 And the new Union would have to be based on a new constitutional order. A nation of free Americans, including emancipated slaves, would bear responsibility for rebuilding the United States on the basis of a constitution acceptable to all. Formally speaking, the original charter of 1787 would remain in place, but it would be so radically transformed that it would stand to the ancien United States as the Code civil related to the French feudal order or, as any redeemed legal culture compares to the brutality and chaos that precedes it.
The American hope for a new beginning lay in the Reconstruction Amendments—the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth—all enacted in quest of a new definition of freedom and equality under the law. The first clause of the Fourteenth Amendment specified who would be a member of the new polity: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. . . .” With a single stroke the new constitution erased the effects of one of the worst blemishes in American constitutional history—the Dred Scott decision of 1857, which held that persons of African descent could never become citizens of the United States. In the new United States, there would be no discrimination based on blood. The only question that mattered was whether you were born within the polity and whether you were therefore likely to come to maturity with the language and consciousness of American culture.
With just boundaries of the new nation-state properly defined, the highest order of business was to define the basic rights of its citizens. The structure of these rights follows the pattern established in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Yet, there was a new recognition that the inalienable rights of all Americans were now to be realized not in the state of nature but under the rule of law. The naturalistic “pursuit of happiness,” celebrated in the Declaration, gives way to the quintessential creature of the law’s definition—property. Yet, the basic rights of life, liberty, and property are inalienable without being absolute. The ideal must be adapted to the practical demands of competing claims. The legal system would have to decide when individuals could fairly be deprived of liberty or property or even of life; thus, the coining of the famous and influential clause of the American Constitution, namely that no “State [shall] deprive any person of life, liberty, or Property, without due Process of law.” The law would define the content and the limits of the inalienable rights celebrated in the Declaration of Independence.
Also, for the first time, the law would define duties incumbent on the states. The individual state governments must not only guarantee due process for all persons within their jurisdiction, they must also secure “the equal protection of the laws” for all to whom their power extends. True, the original Constitution places some limits on the legislative competence of the states. They must defer to the supremacy of federal law and recognize the privileges and immunities of the citizens of all other states.11 And there were specific restrictions: They could not enact bills of attainder, ex-post facto laws, or any “law impairing the obligation of contracts.”12 In the postbellum constitutional order, however, the states acquired a pervasive duty to treat their residents—those subject to their jurisdiction—decently.
This was a revolutionary change. The states were no longer the autonomous sovereigns that they thought they were when they claimed the right of secession. They were now, in fact, servants of their people. Governments existed to guarantee due process and equal justice for all. The local law was no longer simply a creature of the states. The states themselves were enmeshed in the law and subordinate to it.
In addition to embedding the states in the rule of law, the new constitutional order embarked on an affirmative program to ensure equality among those citizens subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The heart of the new consensus is that the federal government, victorious in warfare, must continue its aggressive intervention in the lives of its citizens. It must protect the weak against the risk that they would slip into states of subordination resembling the past from which they sought to escape. According to the Thirteenth Amendment, there could never again be relationships of slavery or involuntary servitude in the United States. The federal government would have to be ever watchful to insure that this kind of slippage would never occur in the private relationships among citizens. Furthermore, under the “equal protection clause,” the states must recognize and promote the equality of those subject to their jurisdiction. To round out the commitment to equality, according to the Fifteenth Amendment ratified in 1870, the states could no longer deny voting rights to citizens on the grounds of their race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
These objectives and guarantees are insufficient in themselves to create a constitution, a framework of government. One needs, in addition, a definition of legislative empowerment that would enable the federal government to realize its commitments. This definition is laid down in all three of the postbellum amendments. All three grant the power to Congress to enforce the basic framework “with appropriate legislation.” True, the new Congress takes as a given many of the provisions of the original Constitution. The new order inherits an operating Congress, Executive, and Judiciary. They would be recast in new functions, but the forms remained the same.
The argument, then, is that the three Reconstruction Amendments enacted a second American constitution. The terms of this constitution, as culled from the amendments—with some rearrangement and leaving out historically specific clauses—can be stated in a few words:

The Second American Constitution
§1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.
§2. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.
§3. No State shall deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.
§4. No State shall deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. 
§5. Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States.
§6. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
§7. The Congress shall have power to enforce the foregoing provisions by appropriate legislation.

These seven propositions summarize the enduring content of the Reconstruction Amendments.13 The key provisions of these amendments define political membership, articulate basic rights, and provide an ambit of legislative competence. So reformed, the American system of government would be able to protect individual rights as well as promote the equality of all persons who survived the war. Of course, we must assume a set of institutions—a Congress, an Executive, and a Judiciary—that will continue to function according to the terms of their initial creation.
Still, there is something missing in this filtering off of the three Reconstruction Amendments and calling them a separate constitution. The missing factor is the consciousness of setting forth a new framework of government, a structure based on values fundamentally different from those that went before. To find that consciousness, we need to turn, I wish to argue, to the critical message of the Civil War, the address that would generate a new normative world in which to make sense of the epic war that consumed America from the firing on Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox. The new Nomos, the new framework of values that necessitated a new constitution, comes forth in one of the great prayers of the American civil religion, the Gettysburg Address. It is worth recalling some of the enduring phrases of this civil prayer, the incantations that reverberated in American consciousness:

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation. . . .
[This nation was] conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
From these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.
We resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom. . . .
Government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.
In the ensuing chapters, we will look at these words and the entire address in greater detail. For now, I wish to make the unusual claim that these revered words serve as the preamble for the constitutional order that emerged from the unification of the nation. They are a preamble in much the same sense that the language beginning “Conscious of our responsibility before God and humanity” provides the organizing principle of the new German constitution or the following words echo in memory as the convening of the Philadelphia Constitution:

We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.

Constitutional preambles speak in prophecy. They set forth a vision of the future—for the broad purposes of the national charter that they introduce. And, most important, they define who the people are who share in the constitutional vision. The original preamble in the Philadelphia version stressed the position of “We the People” as the enactors of the Constitution. For Lincoln, the body politic expressing itself in the new constitution included the prior generations who “four score and seven years ago” adopted, with great courage, that proposition of equality that gave birth to the American nation. Those represented in the new order included the dead at Gettysburg and at all the battlefields of the war who, if the new order is realized, “shall not have died in vain.” And, furthermore, because he avoided all partisan references in his address, he clearly meant to articulate a conception of the nation that included the South as well as the North, black as well as white. Ultimately, the beneficiaries of the new order would be the future generations of the nation, those who would flourish under “a new birth of freedom.”
To say that the Gettysburg Address provides the preamble to a new constitutional order is, to say the least, a bold claim. When Lincoln took the train up to Gettysburg in November 1863, he had in mind only to comfort the mourners of those who died in the fierce four-day battle in early July. The bodies were being pulled together from the battlefield and spared further decay. The soil was turned and the dead laid to rest. The battle had turned the tide of the war—just barely, mind you—and it was time that the president began to articulate the meaning of the long suffering that culminated in the gruesome hand-to-hand fighting in the Gettysburg fields.
At the ceremony dedicating the Gettysburg cemetery, Lincoln was designated the second speaker. The renowned orator Edward Everett spoke for two hours before the president mounted the podium. He had a written text with him that amounted to about 268 words.14 Perhaps Everett prepared the audience to absorb the poignancy of Lincoln’s message. Perhaps the very brevity of Lincoln’s words lent them additional power. The impact of the address was felt not only by the mourners gathered at the new cemetery but by an entire country yearning for a sense of meaning in the bloodshed.
True, the Gettysburg Address was not legally binding, but preambles are never meant to have the status of positive law. They are designed to explain why it is necessary for the government to bind itself to certain objectives. Lincoln’s preamble, accepted in the hearts of the nation, explains the meaning of the war and provides a guide to the building of a constitutional order based on nationhood, equality, and democracy. The setting of clear goals in inspiring language—this is all one can expect of a constitutional preamble.
This constitutional order stands in radical contrast to the Constitution drafted in Philadelphia and amended by the Bill of Rights in 1791. It defines membership in the American nation, it brings the principle of equality to the fore, and it initiates the process of extending the franchise to virtually all adult citizens. The original Constitution did none of these things. It slighted the problems of nationality and citizenship, it sidestepped the problem of equality, and it minimized the significance of popular democracy.


The Irrelevance of 
Original Intent

At the outset, I should be clear about the claims I am not making and the methods I am not using. Above all, I am not making an argument about the “original intent” that lay behind the Reconstruction Amendments. Nothing strikes me as intellectually and morally more impoverished than the current trend in constitutional scholarship to believe that the wishes, desires, and intentions of the founders should determine the content of our Constitution. There are two major hurdles that the advocates of this method have never negotiated. First, we need an argument about whose wishes, desires, and intentions really matter. If we think we are bound by a certain take on the world that prevailed in 1787, 1791, or 1868, then we should decide whose sentiments matter. Should we look to the people who wrote the document, to the majority who voted for it, to the states who ratified it, or to the “people” as a whole for whom these various democratic agents acted? Among all these possible sources of “original intent,” there was intense conflict. I would imagine that even those who actually voted for and against various drafts suffered from doubt and changing sentiments. But even if each person voting had a concrete intention to support every sentence he or she endorsed, there is no coherent way of finding a common denominator among their divergent positions. A single intent cannot unify the inevitable cacophony of desires that stand behind every piece of legislation. But let us suppose there was a single intent of the group. We then encounter a more basic question: Why should we care what the founders actually thought?
The best political theory to support the relevance of original intent would be to think of the lawgiver as something like a military commander.15 The commander wants us to do something, and has used the language of the law to move us toward action. We should try to figure out what these purposes are and execute them. And if we don’t? Well, the commander cannot really punish us, but somehow we would be breaking faith with the framers if we don’t act with the appropriate subservience or at least act as though we were submissive to the original intent of the founders. This, I regret to say, is the best reconstruction I can offer for a view that never seems to get articulated; namely, why we should pay so much attention to the wishes and desires of the agents who bequeathed to us the words we live by.
In great historical moments of law making as well as literature, writers choose words that resonate far beyond their original context. When the representatives of the colonies “pledged their sacred honor” in July 1776 to a document that included the words “All men are created equal,” they may merely have intended to stress the equality of all “collective” peoples: the new Americans had as much right to choose their form of government as did the British. They also could have had the limited purpose of arguing that they were of the same moral status as King George III. If all men are created equal, then no one of them can claim to be anointed as ruler by divine right. The only source of legitimacy, as the Declaration argues, is the “consent of the governed.” Whatever their intentions as individuals or as a group may have been, their words had lasting significance. They bequeathed a great maxim to the American people—a maxim that would in due course serve as the battle cry of emancipation.
When the drafters and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment adopted a commitment to equality under the law, they did not think particularly about whether they wanted to bring about integrated schools. Yet, a vast literature has grown up around the question of whether the “original intent” of the Fourteenth Amendment was to integrate the schools—an event that the Court did not mandate until 1954 in Brown v Board of Education.16 The dispute seems to be entirely irrelevant.17 The complex body of national and state legislators who drafted, passed, and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not think about a single system of education for blacks and whites. There were too many other issues on their minds. We cannot attribute to them an intention to have all Americans study together in the same classroom, nor can we burden their memory with a commitment to keep black and white forever apart.
Those who frame constitutions and constitutional amendments obviously have some purpose in mind, but the purposes are typically abstract. If they want to bring about equality among all Americans, they do not want to be bothered with working out precisely what equality means at each stage of historical evolution. If you had asked them whether, ninety years later, the schools should be desegregated, they would have been nonplussed by the question. “Well, that is the reason we have courts,” would have been the typical reply. The Fourteenth Amendment established an ideal, it affirmed an idea that has roots in the Declaration of Independence. The drafters implicitly endorsed the principle that all men are created equal and because they are created equal, they are entitled to equal treatment before the law. What this language should mean in practice was not their concern. Together with scholars who reflect on the ideas behind the law, the courts assume responsibility for the proper interpretation of the language that constitutes a shared heritage of government principles.
I never cease to be amazed that legal scholars, particularly in the United States, continue to be confused about the relevance of the framers’ original intent. Secular legal systems could not possibly be more demanding, more deferential to authority, than religious cultures that believe that their binding legal principles were declared by God. Yet, a story from the Talmud beautifully illustrates the folly of invoking original intent in a dispute about the meaning of God’s commandments. A group of rabbis were engaged in a debate about whether a particular earthenware oven was kosher or not. One of them, Rabbi Eliezer, said no; the other rabbis said yes. Rabbi Eliezer proceeded to invoke a variety of fantastic signs to support his view: at his command, a carob tree was uprooted and flew across the field, a stream flowed upstream, and the walls started to collapse before they were halted. The rabbis were not impressed by these signs. Then Rabbi Eliezer, desperate and alone, invoked the argument of original intent: “If I am right, let heaven be the proof.” A heavenly voice then proclaimed: “How dare you oppose Rabbi Eliezer, whose views are everywhere the law.” Rabbi Joshua arose and quoted Deuteronomy: “It is not in Heaven.” Rabbi Jeremiah explained the reference: Ever since the Torah was given at Mount Sinai, “we pay no attention to heavenly voices, for God already wrote in the Torah at Mount Sinai.”18 The point is that once the language is released and given to jurists to fashion to the needs of their time, the task of lawgivers is finished. Their intentions and desires cannot rule—either from the grave or from heaven.
The intention of those who framed the Reconstruction Amendments should, therefore, not control their interpretation today. But what about the intention of Abraham Lincoln, when he mounted the podium on November 19, 1863? There are some who will say that if Lincoln did not intend specifically to articulate the preamble to a new constitution, then the words spoken at Gettysburg could not possibly be, as I claim, the preamble to the postbellum constitution. If Roosevelt did not intend to amend the Constitution with his court-packing plan, then the resulting changes in Supreme Court attitudes could not constitute a de facto amendment, a radical transformation of American law.
Here we take a page from British constitutional history to understand how a practice can be become part of the accumulated historical constitution without this being the purpose of those who initiated the practice. The British Constitution remains, as is well known, famously unwritten. Customary rules determine the role of the Crown in a system that has evolved as a constitutional monarchy. Only the accepted practice of generations prescribes that the queen must sign legislation for it to be binding as law or that the queen may intervene, under certain circumstances, to break a party deadlock and select a nominee for prime minister.19 In all systems of customary law, the relevant perspective is not that of those who first engage in the practice but rather of those who witness the pattern of the past and adopt it as binding on themselves. So it is with the Gettysburg Address. The right question is not what Lincoln intended, but rather what the words meant to those who looked to them as the explanation of the war and as a charter for freedom and equality for all Americans. If the address had been ignored, it would not have mattered what Lincoln intended. But because these 268 words20 were adopted into the civil religion of the United States—the secular meditation on who we were and what we were about—their life after formal recitation by the president determines their constitutional status. They are the preamble to the constitutional order because we came to understand them as nearly sacred. And although we did not until now think of this secular prayer as the preamble to a new order of nationhood, equality, and democracy, that is what they became.
These words are, in fact, better known in the United States than the preamble to the first Constitution. Schoolchildren routinely recite them and thereby imbibe the intuition that these words defined America after the Civil War. Yet, because we know these resonant phrases, we rarely stop to listen and ponder the meaning of each well-crafted line. Let us now put ourselves among the crowd of mourners at Gettysburg. Let us transport ourselves back into the frame of mind of those suffering losses, those looking for the meaning of brothers slaughtering brothers.

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great Civil War, testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate—we cannot consecrate—we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the earth.```

The genius of the Gettysburg Address is that it took the words of the Declaration of Independence and found in them a crystallization of a meaning suitable for the refounding of American democracy. In 1776, the idea that “all men are created equal—for all purposes” had no precedent in the declarations of political leaders. Even the great French Declaration of the Rights of Man, issued thirteen years after the French Revolution, preached a more limited version of equality—“All men are born and remain equal under the law.”1 In its original context, the famous five words “all men are created equal” had a limited function. They undermined the pretension of King George III to rule under the divine right of kings. If all men were of equal stature under God, then no one could claim to have been anointed as ruler by supernatural authority. At the same time, however, the famous maxim could also be understood as referring to “men” as collective entities: “all peoples have equal status.” It was not particularly novel to argue that all nations, all states, had an equal claim to govern themselves. The principle of national self-determination, urged so adamantly in the twentieth century, derives from the same source: every nation is entitled to preserve its own culture, cultivate its language, and express itself as a subject of the international community. International law is based on the idea that nations, anchored in the form of states, enter into legal relationships. The states in which nations are embodied enjoy legal personalities. They incur debts and, significantly, these debts are not extinguished by revolutionary changes of government. The forms of the state come and go, and the nation endures through it all. It is no wonder, therefore, that the Declaration of Independence would assert that the American people were equally entitled, with all other nations, to determine their form of government.
These two senses of the famous “all men are created equal” capture the ambiguous quality of the American revolt against the British. It was both a revolutionary and an anticolonial war of independence. The revolutionary spirit was captured in the categorical rejection of monarchy. The anticolonial thrust appears in the assertion of the Americans’ equal claim to rule by “consent of the governed.”
More far-reaching than both of these original meanings, however, is the individualist interpretation: All human beings are of equal dignity. They are created equal and remain equal in the eyes of their Creator. There can be no foundation, therefore, for the claim that whites are superior to blacks or that men should count more than women. Of course, many framers of the Declaration were slave owners and most, if not all of them, were patriarchal heads of households. Yet, they bequeathed to the world a rhetorical phrase that was pregnant with meaning deeper than many of them may have intended. This deeper meaning lay, embedded in the text, ready to come alive for the first time as their Declaration became the sacred text of the American abolitionist movement.
Legal texts often bear one meaning on their surface and a higher meaning that requires faith and personal investment beyond the surface meaning. A good example is the commandment in the Decalogue prohibiting homicide. Allow me a short digression on the commandment against killing to illustrate the phenomenon of a text that carries one meaning on its surface and a more radical meaning beneath.
The Hebrew expression in the Sixth Commandment, lo tirtsach, is generally read: Thou shall not commit murder. The term “murder” implies a prohibition only against unjustified killing, implying the permissibility of killing in self-defense. Yet, a survey of the sources in Jewish law reveal that the term also bears the interpretation found in many Christian translations: Thou shall not kill. “Thou shalt not murder” is a rule that we can expect people to follow, but “Thou shalt not kill” hardly lends itself to the same strict enforcement. The morality of not killing becomes an aspiration, a challenge for people to realize in their struggle with imperfection. Whether they can renounce self-defense, as the Mennonites appear to have done, is a matter of personal moral realization. Whether they can extend the prohibition against killing to all living creatures, as some exemplary spiritual leaders have done, depends on their moral evolution. Those who eat meat are not wrongdoers or sinners. They simply have not yet reached the highest point of aspiration. One should respect the Buddha, for respecting all forms of life by not killing, but those who fall short of the Buddha are not subject to blame.
The same contrast can be drawn between the equality of all nations and the equality of all human beings. The equality of nations has become a postulate of the international legal order. There may be debate about which groups of people constitute nations entitled to self-determination and representation in the international community, but the principle seems to be accepted by all. For the community of nations, so recognized, equality—let us, say, with regard to voting rights in the General Assembly of the United Nations—becomes a norm readily enforced.
Not so for the equality of all human beings. First, it is not at all clear what we mean by equality, why we should recognize it in all human beings, and what we should do to realize equality in practice. Even Lincoln did not favor the equality of blacks for all purposes, including social and marital relationships. And even if we think that all children are equal in the sight of God, we might understandably bequeath our property to our own kin. How much equality and the form that it should take remain a matter of constant debate.
As in the case of “not killing,” in the field of granting equality, there is always more that one can do. The minimum is recognizing an equal “right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” This requires, to be sure, the abolition of slavery. But there arises then the question of equality in the exercise of basic legal rights, like owning property, serving on a jury, and testifying as a witness in court. Some of these basic legal rights of equality did not accrue to women until well into this century. At a further frontier is political equality, namely the right to express opinions, to vote, and to hold office. Further up the scale of equality, we encounter equality of opportunity in economic competition: Every individual should have the right to compete on an equal footing, with equal education and the basic resources required for the market.
At this point in the spectrum, we begin to make the transition from equality of opportunity to equality of outcomes. Everyone should arguably have an equal claim to the world’s resources. The manna of life, in Bruce Ackerman’s apt metaphor, should be distributed equally.2 The accidents of birth prevent us all from having equal talents, but perhaps those born with lesser talents should receive some form of compensation for their deprivation. All other outcomes, as John Rawls argues, would be “arbitrary from a moral point of view.”3 A similar form of compensation might be urged for those who fall short in the unfolding of their lives. Some have bad luck in romance, fail at their creative efforts, suffer the accidental loss of a child. An extreme egalitarian might see an injustice, requiring compensation, in these differential life paths.
We might refer to this layered set of possibilities as the spectrum of equality. As in abstaining from killing, one can cross the initial stage of this spectrum and remain unsure about how far to ascend on the scale. To whatever height one ascends on the spectrum of equality, there should be a strong connection between that perch and the reason for recognizing human equality in the first place. Once again, the analogy with the commandment against killing (or murder) proves instructive. However much one becomes convinced that killing is wrong, one needs a reason for that degree of conviction. In order to renounce self-defense you need a reason, something to the effect that violence only breeds more violence. Or, if you wish to emulate the model of Albert Schweitzer, you must say something like: All living things are the creatures of God, they all deserve to live. This is not to say that your reason must be demonstrably correct, but you need a reason for your commitment for it to make any sense at all.
The abolitionists, too, must have had reasons for believing in equality in a way that both Northern and Southern fellow citizens rejected. Abraham Lincoln, too, followed an inner logic in cultivating the deeper meaning of the Declaration of Independence. And today we must also have grounds for taking human equality seriously as a basic ideal of social and political justice.
Providing these reasons turns out not to be so easy. As a descriptive claim, the thesis “all men are created equal” is obviously false. People differ in every conceivable respect—size, strength, intelligence, musical talent, beauty. But being equal is not equivalent to being the same, identical, or similar. Equality is a curious relationship, and its model is arithmetic relations. Two sides of an equation are stipulated as equal, but this may not be apparent to the untrained eye. For example: 17 x 17 = 289. The two sides of the equation are not identical in notational form but equivalent in numeric value. The suggestion is that all our differences are like notational form. My DNA, my biography, my talents, are certainly not the same as yours, but these differences become superficial in light of the deeper equivalence of moral value. What gives us this deep equality of value?
Some philosophers have tried to analyze human equality by searching for some single factor by virtue of which we are equal. We might all be equal because we can use language and say things like, “I am as good as you are.”4 Utilitarians claim that we are equal because we feel pleasure and pain.5 John Locke argued that we are all equal because we are all the property of God.6 Or as contemporary secular thinkers claim, we are all equal because, in principle, we can act both rationally and reasonably.7 All these arguments suffer from the same objection. Suppose someone could not speak, would he not be equal to other human beings? Suppose she could not feel pleasure or pain, would that put her outside the human community? If he were not rational, would he not be one of us? None of these criteria alone could be an adequate test of equality unless it was accompanied by a theory that explained why that factor, and that factor alone, was sufficient to generate the strong sense of human equality. Of little value, as well, is Locke’s influential argument that we are the property of God. Animals also belong to the same Creator but that does make them equal to humans.
Modern philosophical approaches toward equality all suffer from the same flaw. They are strongly committed, vaguely, to some position on the spectrum, but they offer no reason why they are so intensely committed to this value that has become so powerful in the English-speaking West. Human equality seems to be an unquestioned postulate—one of those truths that we hold to be “self-evident.” And those things that are obvious apparently require no grounding in reasons. In the contemporary liberal culture, equality is one of those values that has become so deeply held that it is neither questioned nor justified.
Given the long history of popular belief in the intrinsic superiority of certain classes of people—men, whites, Christians, Americans—the philosophical belief in equality stands as a critique of commonly held beliefs. It is clear that the popular culture still harbors many biases about some people being intrinsically better, entitled to greater privileges, than others. Yet, the long-range popular trend favors overcoming our biases in favor of a belief in the equality of all humanity. The American Revolution took the first step by abolishing the privileges of the nobly born. The 1787 Constitution prohibits both the states and the federal government from granting “titles of nobility.”8 There was this much equality in the founding, but anchoring the “peculiar institution” of slavery in the Constitution was the great “offence” against equality that could be expiated only on the killing fields of Gettysburg and Antietam.
The postbellum history of the United States has carried the egalitarian message of Gettysburg into the liberation of ever more marginal groups. After the emancipation of blacks, the movement for women’s suffrage gained strength and finally triumphed in 1920, and then in unclear succession came the contemporary efforts toward the equal treatment of homosexuals, “illegitimate” children, the handicapped, and even undocumented aliens.9 The thrust toward inclusion of more and more groups within the inner circle of the equally privileged has been one of the central themes of American life. Yet, even the victory of the Civil War is not yet complete. The badges and vestiges of slavery still haunt the land. The quest for redemption from the original sin of slavery continues in our own time.
Our sensibilities are conditioned by our history. But, however difficult the struggle, we have a history of which we can be proud. We Americans were the first to conceptualize the great maxim of equality and to label it a self-evident truth. No other legal system, so far as I can tell, relies explicitly on the principle that all human beings are created in the image of God. Yet, all modern legal systems and international documents of human rights today subscribe to the principle of equality before the law. Typical of the American influence is the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man, which provides in the second part of Article 6: “The law must be the same for everyone, regardless whether it serves to protect or to punish.”10
Equality before the law is the most limited claim of human equality. This form of equality applies only to fellow nationals and residents subject to the same legal order. More ambitious are the arguments of the philosophers such as Ackerman and Rawls who claim that equality is the first principle of social justice. At the outer reaches of principle, we find the great maxim invoked in the Gettysburg Address: All human beings are equal in the sight of God.
Let us limit our thinking, for the time being, to the most modest claim—that all individuals, black and white, men and women, gay and straight, born in wedlock and out of wedlock, should be treated equally under the law. We did not recognize this principle in the 1787 Constitution. It came into our positive law—the law actually applied by the courts—in 1868 with the Fourteenth Amendment. But what is the grounding for this transformation in our attitudes toward equality under law? Did we need the more radical faith in equality in the sight of God to discover the imperative of treating everyone equally under the law? Is equality under law limited to Americans? If so, why does the Fourteenth Amendment literally protect all “persons” against the American states that deprive them of equal protection of the laws? These are the difficult issues to which we now turn.


The Nation as the Crucible 
of Equality

Gettysburg forged a link between the nation and egalitarian thinking that we sometimes forget. The connection between the limited nation and unbounded equality has paradoxical overtones. The nation is dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. The thrust toward equality has universalist implications. Neither Lincoln in 1863 nor the founders in 1776 argued that only “Americans” were created equal. The claim was that all people—in principle, all human beings on the planet—are born with equal dignity. Yet, this universalistic thinking thins our commitment to equality to a point of fragility.
Equality flourishes in an environment of mutual sympathy and reciprocal identification. The love for each and the needs of each come to the fore in the affective bonds of family, friendship, tribe, and, by extension, in the reciprocal attachments of nationhood. The limited political sphere of the nation facilitates the recognition of others as human beings sharing a common history. If blacks and whites, Northerners and Southerners, eventually men and women, could respect each other as Americans participating in the same national drama, they would lay a foundation for affirming their mutual equality. They need not be brothers and not exactly friends, but they could at last recognize each other as compatriots with a common language, a single history, and a shared future.
The source for this association between bonds of affection and equality lies outside the Judeo-Christian tradition, notably in the philosophy of the ancient Greeks. The fullest development comes in Aristotle’s Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics. The idea of universal human equality was foreign to Aristotle, but he did believe in the mutual recognition of equality within the bonds of friendship and other close associations. Indeed, wishing well for the other as an end in himself is an essential component of philia or friendship understood broadly, and this sentiment, Aristotle believed, provides the necessary foundation for all virtuous behavior.11
Equality appears as a central theme in the virtue of justice as well as friendship. The just person is one who pays due regard to his own interests as well as to those of others. He is able to maintain the proper balance between his own interests and those of others. This is an aspect of distributive justice that generally requires each person to receive a due or proportionate share of the good to be distributed. Aristotle describes this proportion as an expression of geometric equality. Similarly, when one person wrongs another, some correction is necessary. This species of justice is also based on equality, understood arithmetically. The wrongdoer and the victim should both be restored to the state they were in prior to the wrong. This might be done by compelling the wrongdoer to pay compensation from the gains that he has received in order to make up the loss to the victim.
These virtues of friendship and justice require cultivation, for they contribute to the flourishing of the virtuous individual. Adapted to the nationalist argument for equality among all Americans, Aristotle’s argument about friendship would go something like this: we should treat all members of the American polity as equal, with equal concern for their lives, precisely as we would treat friends. By so doing, we as a nation will flourish and we as individuals will flourish from our taking the ends of our compatriots as seriously as we would those of friends.
Each nation must seek equality for the sake of its own flourishing. The sense of common destiny is nowhere better expressed than in the Jewish expression: Kol Jehudim eruvim ze bze [All Jews are responsible for each other]. In the rhetoric of American nationalism, the metaphor of the chosen people, of the substitution of Americans for Jews, recurs as a familiar trope. The sense of organic closeness is implied. The responsibility of the American nation should run to all members of the nation, defined in the Fourteenth Amendment as all those naturalized or born on the soil of the United States and subject to its legal jurisdiction.
Nationalism becomes a virtue if it avoids hatred of outsiders as it encourages mutual respect among insiders. This, indeed, was Lincoln’s ambition in seeking reconciliation in the Gettysburg Address and in his second inaugural address. Accepting his idea of a “new nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal” would have enabled Americans to negotiate the postbellum period without self-seeking and rancor. But this was not, as we saw, the way it happened, particularly after the tragic turn at Ford’s Theatre.
Andrew Johnson’s plan for Reconstruction was plagued by controversies about whether the previously disloyal were still full members of the nation and whether blacks, once emancipated, should ascend a step higher and receive the franchise on equal terms with whites. Lincoln imagined grounding the equality between black and white, Northern and Southern, in a shared sense of nationhood. With the rancorous infighting that dominated Congress in the period 1865 to 1870, the relevance of nationhood began to recede. More important were the ideological issues of loyalty, personal desert, and political self-interest. The question of the black franchise became associated with the fears of Democrats that a coalition of freedmen and Republicans would dominate the postbellum South.
But this should not surprise us. Politics merely occupies the surface of our lives. The give-and-take of daily conflict can lead us easily to forget both our shared purposes and our enduring principles. The Civil War had ushered in a commitment to the equality of all members of the nation. Whatever the struggle for adoption may have been, the language of egalitarian principle came into force. By 1868, we had in place a clause in the Fourteenth Amendment that was unique in American constitutional history: no state could “deprive any person of the equal protection of the laws.” What this clause would imply in practice, no one quite knew. We did know, however, that the legal idea of equality carried no historical gloss. The Constitution had already spoken of “privileges and immunities”12 and the Bill of Rights, of securing “life, liberty, and property” against deprivation “without due process of law.”13 But the Constitution had never before contained the notion of equality of persons before the law.
The remarkable feature of this ideal-bearing language is that it protects all persons within the power of the state—all those whom the state can touch with its legal power. This was hardly a self-evident way for the provision to be drafted. Given the nationalist background of our sentiments of equality, one could readily have formulated the clause: “No state shall deny to any American citizen within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” That is, because we were bound together foremost as fellow Americans, one would expect a commitment first to the equal treatment of all Americans. The Weimar Constitution in Germany found this to be a perfectly natural way of formulating the commitment to equality: All Germans are equal before the Law.14 It was not until the postwar Basic Law came to be in 1949 that West Germany recognized that a commitment to equality had to be universal. The provision now reads: All human beings are equal before the Law.15 The striking fact is that Americans came to this principle of universalization as early as 1868.
As the distinguished German constitutional law scholar and philosopher of the Weimar period Gerhard Leibholz pointed out, the Western theory of equality has united two distinct strains of thought.16 The first is the Aristotelian principle, which grounds the virtue of equal treatment in the affective bonds of friendship or, by extrapolation, in the ties of nationhood. The Civil War enabled Americans of different cultural strains, some with power, others without, to see themselves as compatriots of a single nation. Their mutual recognition as partners in a common struggle generated a sense that at least they—the Americans—were created equal.
The second great principle in Leibholz’s egalitarian synthesis stressed the universality of all humans in the love of God. This universalization derives from the biblical faith that all persons are created in the image of God.17 The first is limited and circumscribed by the bonds of affective identification. The second breaks the bonds of the nation and extends to persons unknown and unimagined. We will allow ourselves a slight detour to explore these religious ideas and to understand their impact on the theory of equality as it developed under the Fourteenth Amendment.


The Religious Basis 
of Equality

The abolitionist movement began on the heels of the Second Great Awakening of the first three decades of the century. The country overflowed with the religious pursuit of self-perfection, talk of the millennium—the thousand years of peace before the Second Coming of the Lord—and of the hand of God in human affairs. The American revivalists adopted the Jewish idea that our purpose on earth is to complete and perfect God’s creation. As historian William G. McLoughlin sums up the fervor of the times: “The new consensus also included the belief that Americans are a peculiar race, chosen by God to perfect the world.”18
Many of the preachers of the Awakening supported the abolitionist cause but many others did not. Faith in God and the higher law of revelation enables some people to confront the injustice they see around them; it enables others to retreat and to find solace in their personal quest for salvation. Religious beliefs also supported the cause of those who believed in slavery. Lincoln summed up the ambivalent role of religious faith in the Brothers’ War: “Both [sides] read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.”19
Religious faith hardly lays out a straight path leading to the affirmation of human equality. Yet, it is hardly an accident that many of the great abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison and Theodore Parker were ministers whose faith fired their dedicated opposition to the great sin of one man’s owning another. These men carried with them an intimate knowledge of the Bible, yet they did not require a consensus of biblical interpretation to support their political commitments. Frederick Douglass argued that slavery was a sin because by “subjecting one man to the arbitrary control of another, it contravenes the first command of the Decalogue. . . .”20 He was appealing to the basic principles of monotheism. But sophisticated biblical exegesis was unnecessary for those who shared the root intuition that slavery was an abomination. Lincoln thought it obviously wrong for men “to ask a just God’s assistance in wringing their bread from the sweat of other men’s faces.”21 These were strong intuitions of evil, tutored by religious faith but obviously not determined by the Bible.
The religious abolitionists had every reason to be drawn to the Declaration of Independence; there they found the religious inspiration for which they could search in vain in the secular monument called the Constitution. “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.” Behind those created equal stands a Creator—the source as well of our basic human rights, for the text continues by listing the truths we hold to be self-evident: “that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” This noncommittal Deist theme runs through the rhetoric of 1776. God is mentioned only as “nature’s God,” by virtue of which every people is entitled to “a separate and equal station” in the community of nations. This is the basis for the American people’s claiming that no government may rule them without their consent. The end of the Philadelphia Declaration resonates with another invocation of a higher power: “with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.”
The religious refrain in the charter of our independence differs radically from the flat, secular tone of the 1787 Constitution, which makes no reference to any of the words, “God,” “Creator,” “Providence,” “divine,” or any of their synonyms. The Constitution recognizes no power higher than the will of “We the People.” Yet, the close bond of religious zeal and American politics returns in the Awakening in the early decades of the nineteenth century, a period leading not only to the abolitionist movement but also to the expression of religious passion in foreign policy, particularly in westward expansion under the ideology of manifest destiny.
The invocation of God in the Gettysburg Address is both accidental and entirely predictable. It is accidental in the sense that Lincoln spontaneously added the divine invocation as he neared the end of the address.22 The innovation was predictable. Lincoln’s association of the nation and God derived from his deepest convictions. He thought of Americans as God’s “almost chosen people,” successors to the Jews in a relationship with the Divine that could be described as “almost a covenant.”23 In the mid-nineteenth century, it was relatively easy to believe that we were in the grip of a great historical force, possibly emanating from a higher power. “IN GOD WE TRUST” became a popular motto, appearing for the first time on the nation’s coinage in 1864. Trust in God can generate diverse conclusions, but this does not subtract from the obvious way in which, at the time, faith in God and the Bible nourished the radical claims of human equality.
For modern readers, those who do not think instinctively in the idiom of Genesis and the Psalms, it is worth reviewing the kind of argument for equality found in biblical sources. The central idea that generates the concept of universal humanity or universal brotherhood is that we are made in the image of God. As the story has come down to us from Genesis 1, 26, and 27:

And God said, Let us make man [Adam] in our own image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, over all the cattle, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So God created man in his own image, in his own image He created him, male and female He created them.24

There is much to be said about the proper reading of this passage, particularly in relation to the contrary story of creation in Genesis 2, a story that supposedly justifies the subordination of women. The proper reading of the text, as I have argued elsewhere,25 has God creating a single being, both male and female. God gives this being, called Adam, dominion over all the animals but not over the first woman, yet to be created. Only in the later story of the Garden of Eden do we encounter the curse and subordination of Eve. For those who look to the Bible for guidance, therefore, it makes a tremendous difference whether one relies primarily on the egalitarian message in chapter 1, of ultimate human dignity for all, or on chapter 2, with its story leading to the curse of women that they be “ruled by their husbands.”
That creation in the image of God resonated in the culture of the abolitionists is undeniable; the advocates of emancipation readily read into the line “all men are created equal” the vision of creation set forth in Genesis 1. If you believe that an individual is created in the image of God, it is difficult to deny his or her ultimate worth. There is no higher value than God, and therefore partaking of that value confers upon all human beings ultimate human dignity. This point is brought home in the grounding of the prohibition against homicide in Genesis 9:6:

Whoever sheds man’s blood by man shall his blood be shed;
for in the image of God he made Adam. . . .

The infinite dignity of the potential victim generates an absolute ban on killing. The dignity of the victim is as great as any person who might wish to kill him and, therefore, the homicide of an innocent is never justified. This is a remarkable passage for an era in which the killing of the stranger, the “other,” was a routine occurrence.
The basic ideas of Genesis receive their best secular rendition in the moral philosophy of Immanuel Kant, who takes the idea of creation in the image of God and bequeaths to us the idea of universal humanity. We are all essentially alike as members of the human family. We all partake of infinite human dignity:

In the kingdom of ends everything has either value or dignity. Whatever has a value can be replaced by something else which is equivalent; whatever, on the other hand, is above all value, and therefore admits of no equivalent, has a dignity.26

The idea of human dignity, which we now take to be a shared premise of Western civilization, became the backdrop for our current faith in human rights and crimes against humanity.
The Fourteenth Amendment is our placeholder in the evolution of egalitarian thinking. We know very little about how much equality the framers of the amendment intended to secure, and frankly it does not matter. Each generation must struggle to assay how far they are willing to go in the name of egalitarian justice or, by contrast, how far they wish to surrender to the surviving counter-values of hierarchy. In the aftermath of the Civil War it was clear, ironically, that black men were far ahead of white women in ascending the scale of egalitarian possibilities. Black men acquired, at least nominally, both the right to vote and the right to serve on juries. White women and black women alike would acquire neither until well into the twentieth century.
Some might argue that because the United States lagged in recognizing equal legal rights for women, the mood of 1863 would have been hostile to recognizing that women as well as men were equal in the sight of God.27 When Lincoln said, “All men are created equal,” therefore, he meant men—only males were equal in the sight of the Creator. This objection is easily countered. Lincoln explicitly invoked the figures of women in his discourse on human dignity. In 1857, in his speech attacking the Dred Scott decision, Lincoln explicitly refers to the dignity and inherent equality of black women:

In some respects she certainly is not my equal; but in her natural right to eat the bread she earns with her own hands without asking leave of any one else, she is my equal, and the equal of others.28

Even if the textual evidence were silent, however, we would have to interpret “all men are created equal” as inclusive of all human beings—all variations of women, men, and children. This inclusiveness follows from anchoring the great maxim in the idea that human beings were created in the image of God: “So God created man in God’s own image, in the image of God created God it, the first being, male and female God created them.”29 (I recognize that one reading of the biblical text, widely accepted in various religious traditions, holds that God did create a male Adam in his own image and later removed a rib to create Eve.)
Recognizing the inherent moral equality of women in 1863 did not mean, however, that they would receive full legal and political equality as did black men. The notion of “appropriate roles in life” still governed relations among equals and it would take decades for Americans to grasp that the politics of equality can not brook the coercion of women into domestic, apolitical roles, nor could some misguided theory of social organization tolerate the relegation of blacks to a limited number of lower-status professions.
Human Dignity as a 
Placeholder for Equality

One basic value remains curiously absent from those enthroned in the postbellum legal order. The movement to redeem ourselves from the evil of slavery should have prompted a commitment to a value even more basic than equality: the infinite human value of all human beings. In the wake of the Holocaust, the Germans recognized that this was the proper way to initiate the catalogue of basic rights in the 1949 Basic Law (Constitution): “Human dignity is inviolable. All state power is obligated both to protect this value and to respect it.”30 This provision clearly bears the imprint of Kantian moral philosophy, which treats respect for human dignity as an absolute duty of all individuals, including officers of the state.31
The structure of Article I of the German Basic Law bears a striking resemblance to the Thirteenth Amendment, which in its core provides: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States.” If we think of the prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude as an affirmation of autonomy, then the passive sentence of the Thirteenth Amendment could be rewritten, without change of content, in the form of the German Basic Law:

Human dignity and autonomy are inviolable. All state power is obligated both to protect and respect autonomy, by eliminating slavery and involuntary servitude.

This would, admittedly, be an unconventional way of formulating the demands of the Thirteenth Amendment. The usual commentary on the amendment stresses simply that it omits the requirement of action by state officials that we find in the Bill of Rights and in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Yet, it is clear that the postbellum order sought to declare a fundamental value as the symbol of the new United States. The motive was similar to the impulse of the German drafters seeking to ground their postwar constitution in the humanistic values of human dignity. There may be intriguing and important differences between human dignity and autonomy, and we shall return to these later. For now, it is important to note merely that the postbellum legal order begins with a commitment of all state power to eliminate the evil that had cursed the United States since its founding.
Significantly, both human dignity and autonomy, both due process and equality, transcend the limits of the nation. It is not only our nationals who are entitled to these basic human rights. All human beings, all persons, should enjoy the same rights—at least so far as they are within the jurisdiction of the state securing those rights. Our commitment to nationhood generates the reciprocal sympathy that enables us to make the move from particular to universal. We may come to understand the meaning of basic rights in the context of the nation but then we are driven to see that all persons, whether members of the nation or not, are entitled to the same treatment.


Alternative Readings

Not everyone agrees that the equality of all persons represents the moral breakthrough of the Fourteenth Amendment. In an alternative version of the postbellum legal order, also based on the value of nationhood, Charles Black stresses the reliance on national citizenship in the first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” Membership in the nation is now defined by birth on the land, and the fact of nationality, legally recognized as citizenship, generates the most basic right of the new legal order. Black reasons that the amendment places citizenship at the center of the new constitutional order. “No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.” The centerpiece of the new order, therefore, should have been citizenship and the elaboration of the “privileges and immunities” of citizenship.
The appeal of Black’s reading of the postbellum legal order is that it, too, draws on the Declaration of Independence and the Gettysburg Address. The key phrase in his reading of the Declaration is not the commitment to equality but the clause immediately following: “that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.” Black imagines these words coupled with the language of the Ninth Amendment, which implies an unspecified catalogue of rights “retained by the people.” These “inalienable rights” should express themselves in a catalogue of human rights, including the right to sexual privacy, to reproductive freedom, and to governmental services necessary for the “pursuit of happiness.”32 The latter might plausibly encompass education, medical care, a minimal standard of welfare, and perhaps even guaranteed employment.
There is much to be said for Black’s interpretation of the constitutional text. He brings together strands of our legal culture that until his writing seemed to lack internal coherence. He grounds his argument in the familiar rhetoric of rights. He builds his interpretation on critical planks of the postbellum legal order, namely the ideas of nationhood and national citizenship. Yet, the content of his argument reverts back to the language of rights, inalienable rights, rights retained by the people. He invokes the rhetoric we associate with our eighteenth century Constitution enthroning freedom over equality. True, as the title of Black’s book reminds us, Lincoln’s address does rely on one phrase to establish a link with the old legal order: A New Birth of Freedom. Yet, Black ignores the cardinal values of equality and democracy, which, along with nationhood, represent the cornerstones of the postbellum legal order.
Taking the “privileges and immunities” of citizens as the pivotal value of the new order, as Black does, creates its own problems of equality under law. Why should only citizens and not resident aliens enjoy the inalienable rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?” Do not immigrants and even undocumented illegals have rights as human beings? The universalist language of the Declaration of Independence hardly dovetails with the parochial category of citizenship in a particular governmental polity. If all men are created equal, if we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, it cannot be the case that these rights are limited to those who are classified as the subjects of a particular sovereign.
To be sure, the Reconstruction Amendments had to define citizenship in the United States, at least to heal the divisive scars left by the Dred Scott decision. That infamous act of judicial will, which served only to fuel the passions for war, held that a former slave could never become the citizen of any state. That is why the amendment adds that citizens of the United States are citizens also “of the State wherein they reside.” They could avail themselves, therefore, of a body of law already developed to secure the mutual recognition of the states of “all Privileges and Immunities” of citizens in sister states.33 As history would have it, however, the “privileges and immunities” clause of the Fourteenth Amendment has not had—at least until recently—any impact on constitutional debates.34 The language has lain latent in the text of the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether it will find a suitable purpose in a constitutional scheme built on equality and due process remains to be seen.
Black pursues the theme of freedom and ignores the phrase that in fact requires emphasis in reading Lincoln: a new birth of freedom. The redemption and renaissance of our country would become possible only by confronting our “offences,” and that meant recognizing and compensating for the evil of slavery. The issue that could stimulate a new birth of the nation, therefore, was not freedom itself but freedom tempered by equality before the law.
Yet, there is reason to applaud Black’s reading of our history, as there is to honor the divergent views found in Bruce Ackerman’s and in Akhil Amar’s writings. Ackerman focuses on the de facto transformation of government wrought by the Fourteenth Amendment, enacted by a rump Congress in violation of the express language of the Constitution.35 Amar, too, reads the history in his own way. The postbellum legal order, in his view, shifts our focus from rights that enable us to participate in government to rights that celebrate individual freedom.36 May all these readings flourish. They testify to the innate multiplicity of meanings inherent in the second founding of the United States in the postbellum legal order. Our only problem, then as now, is that we are not sure which way the revolutionary refounding of the nation should go.


The Cusp of Revolution

By 1868 and the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment, we were perched on the threshold of a constitutional revolution. An entirely new legal order was yearning to work its way clear from the turmoil of the 1860s. The foundation of this new order was painted bold in the phrases that resounded at Gettysburg: nationhood, equality, and democracy. The mechanism for implementing these exhortations would be the new grant of congressional authority in the final clause of the new amendments: “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of [these articles].” A more powerful central government was a critical part of the new constitutional order. This would be a government that would raise income taxes, as it started to do during the war. This government would enact welfare legislation to care for the widows and orphans of the war. And, most important, it would be a government that would have the capacity to supervise private relationships. The Constitution was no longer focused just on the individual struggling to secure his freedom against the government. The government would have an active role in protecting and securing the autonomy of its citizens. As my rewriting of the Thirteenth Amendment would have it: Securing and protecting the autonomy of labor would become the duty of all state power. Government would have to keep a vigilant watch on all labor transactions to insure that there never again would arise relationships bordering on slavery or involuntary servitude.
In 1866, Congress began to act on its responsibility to guard against the aftershocks of slavery by prohibiting discrimination in all facilities open to the public. African Americans were part of the public, and they should be entitled, as a matter of equality with others, to have access to public transport, theaters, and hotel accommodations. The first Civil Rights Act, therefore, would seek, in the later words of Justice Harlan, to eliminate “the badges of slavery.”37
The commitment, first and foremost, of the new constitutional order was to the equality of all persons affected by the laws of the United States. No one knew how far our collective promise to realize equality in American life would take us. The Fourteenth Amendment could conceivably have been sufficient to insure equal voting rights for all, doing away with the need for the Fifteenth, the Nineteenth, and later amendments to secure the franchise.
With these ideals in place, we have to recognize that the guns of war had stilled very few of our fundamental social conflicts. The rough and tumble of postbellum politics pitted one segment of the nation against the other. The freedmen could aspire to power in the region where they previously had been slaves. Northern carpetbaggers could join forces with Southern scalawags to remake the agricultural South in the image of the industrial North. At stake was the class structure of the South with its landed gentry commanding a servile class of laborers. Behind the political conflicts, however, was a remaking of the American conception of government. And the states would fight by any legal means necessary to realize the position they could not secure with their sacrifices on the battlefields of recent memory.
If war, in the famous saying of Clausewitz, represents a continuation of politics by other means,38 then postbellum legal disputes stood for a continuation of war by other means. All the disputes that eventually led to armed conflict between the states would begin, in the period after 1865, to plague the courts and throw into question the values that the war should have secured. States’ rights, the holding of blacks in a form of servitude called segregation, withholding the franchise from women—all of these would remain central issues for at least another hundred years.```
