In this lab, I will show you the alternative terminal commands to `less`.

Through the use of chatGPT, I was able to obtain 4 other terminal command alternatives, including: `cat`, `head`, `tail`, and `more`.

Here is an image of my usage of [chatGPT created by openAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/):

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF LESS AND HOW IT WORKS
less is a command that shows a file's contents one screen at a time. When you run `less` on a file, you will enter a screen with juse the content of that file. To exit the current screen, you have to press `q`

# 1) CAT
`cat` is a command line that immediately prints out the content inside a file. It is very convenient as it prints the content our directly into the current working terminal.

`tail` is a command that prints the last N number of data of the given file
