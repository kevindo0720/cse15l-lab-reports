# 1) INSTALL AND GET VSCODE WORKING 

First, you need to install VSCode, a very easy to use integrated development environment (IDE). This is the [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/) that I used to download VSCode.
After downloading and opening VSCode, you need to access exisitng files/folders or createing new ones. Since I already downloaded VSCode for a class 
last quarter, I did not need to reinstall it. Here is a screenshot of what my VSCode looks like when I open it:

Here is what it looks like when I access an existing file on my computer:

We will be entering commands in the terminal at the bottom of the screen.
