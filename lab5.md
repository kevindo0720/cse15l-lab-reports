# LAB 5 REPORT

In this lab, I will redo lab report 3 but with a differnet command. In lab report 3, I show you the alternative terminal commands to `less`, here, I will 
show the alternative commands to "grep".

Through the use of [chatGPT created by openAI](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt), I was able to obtain other terminal command alternatives to `grep`, including: `grep -r`, `grep -i`, `grep -v`, and `grep -c`.

# GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF LESS AND HOW IT WORKS
grep is a command that searches for a given pattern in a single file or multiple files.

# 1) grep -r
`grep -r` is a command line that searches for a pattern recursively within a directory 

In example 1, I will use the Fletcher's directory in the non-ficton folder and use `grep -r` on the entire directory to find all lines that contains the 
word "parochial"

**Example 1:**
```
kevindo@Kevins-MacBook-Pro-2 OUP % grep -r "parochial" /Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher/

/Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch1.txt:Seeking redemption under the law cannot simply be a desire for one’s parochial values to triumph in the courts. It matters which values are in play. And it matters how these values are debated in the legal culture. Debate about legal issues must be open and robust, and the very process of legal argument must communicate respect for the opposition. At the end of a legal argument, both sides must have the sense that they have been listened to, and that the dignity of the losing party is affirmed in the process of decision. Here, as well, we have much to learn from the model provided by the Jewish tradition of Talmudic debate. When a rabbi questioned how two of the greatest sages, Rabbis Hillel and Shammai, could persistently disagree, the response was: “These and these are the words of the living God.” Although Rabbi Hillel’s views are generally followed, Rabbi Shammai is treated, in defeat, with the greatest respect.
/Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch5.txt:Taking the “privileges and immunities” of citizens as the pivotal value of the new order, as Black does, creates its own problems of equality under law. Why should only citizens and not resident aliens enjoy the inalienable rights of “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness?” Do not immigrants and even undocumented illegals have rights as human beings? The universalist language of the Declaration of Independence hardly dovetails with the parochial category of citizenship in a particular governmental polity. If all men are created equal, if we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights, it cannot be the case that these rights are limited to those who are classified as the subjects of a particular sovereign.
/Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch9.txt:The opposition to victims’ rights stems from both prosecutors and defense counsel. The former do not want victims complicating the trial. They are surely opposed to my proposal that victims be able to veto plea bargains and insist on going to trial to vindicate their charges.11 Prosecutors generally like to have victims around at the sentencing phase. The suffering and rage of the victims, when expressed in court, tends to spike the punishment. Defense counsel are opposed for other reasons. They are afraid that empowering victims will distract from the rights of criminal defendants, but this is not necessarily the case.12 The victim’s interest is primarily in participating in the trial. He or she may communicate a desire for conviction but that parochial sentiment of interest will be readily discounted by the commonsense responses of the jury. The fact is that it is possible to strengthen the participatory rights of victims without unduly complicating the procedure or compromising the traditional rights of the defense.
/Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/non-fiction/OUP/Fletcher//ch10.txt:The problem of exploitation in apparently voluntary sexual relations has long been with us. In the late nineteenth century, the problem was whether the Mormon practice of polygamy should be regarded as protected as liberty and the free expression of religious conviction. Those who defended the institution, as provided in the accepted Mormon religious doctrines of the time, cited its social benefit of caring for all the women and children in a society in which the available men had fallen victim to the hardships of settlement and warfare. The critics, by contrast, claimed that the choice of the women in these cases is not really free and voluntary. John Stuart Mill, a great advocate of liberty, sided with the critics of polygamy.15 Western governments have had no qualms about prohibiting the practice, sometimes for parochial religious reasons, sometimes out of solicitude for women who are subjected to an institution that arguably diminishes their status. The Mormons sued, thinking they had the kind of argument that eventually prevailed in the Lochner case. In 1878, the Supreme Court upheld the conventional view that the prohibition represents permissible intervention by the state to protect the weak against entering into exploitative relationships.16 Many voices today argue that this decision was wrong. The freedom to choose any form of domestic arrangement one wants should prevail against the state’s concern to protect people against their own potentially bad choices.

Here thre are instances in ch1, ch5, ch9, and ch10 that contains the word "parochial".

**Example 2:**
Similarly, in example 2, I used `grep -r` to find the word "ice skating" in the entire travel-guides directory

```
kevindo@Kevins-MacBook-Pro-2 written_2 % grep -r "ice skating" /Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/travel_guides/
/Users/kevindo/Documents/skill-demo1-server/skill-demo1-data/written_2/travel_guides//berlitz2/Poland-WhatToDo.txt:For kids with energy to burn, there are water parks and swimming pools (see above) in summer and ice rinks in winter. To go ice skating, check out the Stegny Skating Track (Tor Lyzwiarski Stegny), (ul. Inspektowa 1, Tel. 842 27 68) or Torwar (ul. Lazienkowska, Tel. 621 44 71) in Warsaw. Another activity that is all the rage is paintball, and there are multiple fields where you can inflict paint rather than pain. Try Marcus-Graf (ul. Widok 10, in Beniaminów near Warsaw; Tel. 816 10 08), TM Pretor (ul. Zaaruskiego 6, Warsaw; Tel. 838 25 35), Rival Paintball Guns (ul. Bartosika 10/77, Warsaw; Tel. 671 22 63), or Extreme Sports (ul. Klaudyny 18/5, Warsaw; Tel. 833 73 73). Paintballers in Kraków should check out Ultimate Sports (near fort Bodzanów; Tel. 431 20 61). 
```

Here, I was able to find "ice skating" in Poland-WhatToDo.txt file.

# 2) grep -i
`grep -i` searches for a command regardless of the case. In other words, `grep -i` is case-insensitive. 

**Example 1**
Here, I used `grep -i` to search for the word "RoManTIC". Because `grep -i` is case insensitive, it will just search for all instances of "romatic" regardless of cases.
```
kevindo@Kevins-MacBook-Pro-2 berlitz2 % grep -i "RoManTIC" California-WhereToGo.txt 

San Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town. Its natural setting, nestled in the hills around the bay, makes the city uncommonly cozy; the zip in the air is invigorating, and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling. If you have a car, one way to begin your visit is to travel along 49-Mile Drive, which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights. You’ll need to use a good map, as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate. Stop off at Twin Peaks (the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street) for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay, then park the car, put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes, and take to the city’s first-class public transport system (see page 120). 
At Nepenthe, Orson Welles built a honeymoon cottage for Rita Hayworth in the days when film stars did the romantic things expected of them by their adoring public. Now it has been expanded and converted into a restaurant, well worth a visit for its incomparable view of the ocean.
```

**Example 2**
Similarly, here, I used `grep -i` command to look for "ChEaP" in Budapest-WhatToDo.txt. As expected, it disregards the cases in "cheap" and just look for the word "cheap".
```
kevindo@Kevins-MacBook-Pro-2 berlitz2 % grep -i "ChEaP" Budapest-WhatToDo.txt 
Not very long ago, a fistful of dollars would have given you the freedom of most Budapest shopping streets. The end of communism, the imposition of VAT at 16 percent, and the effect of inﬂation have, however, brought an end to those bargain-basement days. As ever, artisans provide the bulk of the best buys, but it is worth bearing in mind that their hand-produced items can’t compete with the price of the mass-produced substitutes from the Far East. If something is extremely cheap, chances are that it’s a clever imitation.
```



# 3) grep -E

`less -N` is a command that assigns each line in the file a number. 


**Example 1**
In this example, I used `less -N` to assign numbers to lines in chapter 2 of Berk

      5 Talia and Jim’s fear of helping 7-year-old Anselmo with his homework, lest they create a dependent, immature child, is a peculiarly Western—and profoundly American—preoccupation. American middle-class parents typically regard young chi      5 ldren as dependent beings who must be urged toward independence. In response to researchers’ queries, they frequently say that babies should be trained to be self-reliant from the ﬁrst few months.1 Consequently, they place a high value      5  on children’s learning and doing on their own. Repeatedly relying on others for assistance is construed as weakness, uncertainty, and lack of capacity. In keeping with this view, many American parents worry that if their children seek      5  help, they may become dependent. 
      6 A similar view permeates traditional classrooms, where an individualistic value system prevails. Children must “do their own work.” In the most intensely individualistic of these settings, conferring with your neighbor is worse than de      6 pendency; it is cheating, and teachers go so far as to set up barriers between pupils, such as upright books and cardboard screens, to prevent it.
      7 This emphasis on independent accomplishment is not broadly accepted around the world. Indeed, adults in some non-Western cultures regard American parents as rather merciless in pushing their young children toward independence—for examp      7 le, when they insist that infants sleep alone rather than with their parents, or when they take pleasure in the earliest possible mastery of motor skills, such as crawling and walking, long before the child has acquired the reasoning p      7 owers to avoid steep staircases and busy roadways.2
      8 Diverse non-Western peoples and American ethnic minorities stress interdependence—that children must feel intimately linked to others to become competent and self-reliant. Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Guatemalan-Mayan, eastern Kentuc      8 ky Appalachian, and many other cultural groups regard newborn infants as psychologically separate beings whose most important task is to develop an interdependent relationship with their community—an emotional and social foundation tha      8 t is crucial for survival and learning.3 Witness the following conclusion by a researcher who compared American with Japanese infant rearing practices: “An American mother–infant relationship consists of two individuals . . . a Japanes      8 e mother–infant relationship consists of only one individual, i.e., mother and infant are not divided.”4 These contrasting parenting perspectives reﬂect underlying family and community values. Japanese parents and other ethnic minoriti      8 es adhere to a collectivist worldview, in which people deﬁne themselves in terms of their relationships with others.
      9 Collectivist values also alter the way teachers and children think about classroom learning. Were you to visit a school on an Israeli kibbutz (cooperative agricultural settlement), you would ﬁnd an explicit emphasis on cooperation and       9 avoidance of pupil comparisons, and a far more positive attitude toward children who seek help than is common in American schools. When asked why children look at each others’ work, kibbutz pupils mention the importance of connecting w      9 ith others to acquire new skills. They explain, “If your picture looks crooked, you would want to see your friend’s paper to learn how to make it straight,” or “If you aren’t sure what you’re supposed to do, then you should check.” To       9 the same question, American and Israeli urban children typically respond, “I would want to see whose picture was the best,” or “I might be wondering whether she got more right than I did.”5

     12 from interdependency to autonomy
     13 
     14 Vygotsky, who studied and wrote about children’s development in Russia in the early twentieth century, was deeply interested in how interdependency—children’s close ties to their community—can pave the way to competence and autonomy. H     14 is sociocultural theory has thoroughly collectivist cultural roots. Vygotsky stressed that children need social interaction and meaningful activities to develop, and he regarded high intrinsic motivation and mature, independent functio     14 ning as arising from the support granted by cultural experts as children attempt ever more challenging tasks. The child’s mind, Vygotsky pointed out, “extends beyond the skin” and is inseparably joined with other minds. Out of this int     14 erconnection springs mastery, proﬁciency, and self-conﬁdence.6
     15 Nevertheless, a deeply ingrained American belief is that satisfying a young child’s desire for social contact and assistance will be habit forming, leading to a clingy, spoiled youngster. Much evidence veriﬁes that this is not ordinari     15 ly so.
     16 Consider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and baby during the ﬁrst year of life. By age 6 to 8 months, infants single out their parents and other stable, loving caregivers for expressions of joy and turn to them      16 for comfort when anxious and afraid. An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregiving—responding to the baby’s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriately—supports the developm     16 ent of a secure attachment relationship.7 Securely attached infants actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar, responsive caregiver. Yet such infants are not destined to become immaturely dependent! Rather, b     16 y the end of the ﬁrst year, their exploration of the physical world is conﬁdent, persistent, and complex. And they are less likely to cry and more likely to use gestures and words to express their desires than are infants whose parents     16  delayed or failed to respond to their calls for help.8 
     17 Sensitive care builds an interdependent relationship between parent and baby—one in which physical and emotional closeness becomes the context for encouraging more mature behavior. Attachment serves as the springboard for a great many      17 capacities that make their ﬁrst appearance in the second year—self-conﬁdence, compliance and cooperation; awareness of others’ needs and desires, and empathy and sympathy (emotions that enable us to feel for and help others in need).9      17 But the parent who fails to respond promptly and predictably, intervening only after the baby has become extremely agitated, teaches the infant to rise rapidly to intense distress. The baby has learned that only when he is distraught w     17 ill the parent reliably come to his aid. As a result, he is more dicult to soothe, to encourage to communicate in ways other than crying, and to guide in acquiring other vital competencies.10
     18 An analogous circumstance exists at older ages, as Anselmo’s interactions with his parents reveal. Jim’s refusal to help Anselmo with his homework, in hopes of instilling independence, is counterproductive. Anselmo’s crying and pleadin     18 g accelerate, to the point that anxiety prevents him from focusing on the task. Denying Anselmo assistance yields precisely what it was intended to prevent—a dependent, doubting child. As Anselmo’s parents refrain from helping, they fu     18 el his anger and demandingness, and ultimately his sense of helplessness. When Talia ﬁnally responds, she does so out of desperation—to stop Anselmo’s agitated appeals, which are about to escalate beyond control. Consequently, Talia as     18 sists inappropriately, by doing the task for him.
     19 Anselmo’s resulting disorganized behavior and dependency prompt additional parental vacillation—sometimes refusals to help, at other times maladaptive helping—along with exasperation and criticism. Talia and Jim can be heard saying imp     19 atiently, “You aren’t any good at this!” “Can’t you do anything?”11 Soon a barrier forms between Anselmo and the task he had previously wanted to master, and his motivation wanes.
     20 In classrooms, the same sequence of events prevails. Teachers’ communication plays a vital role in children’s eort and learning. Consider a recent study, in which 1,600 elementary- and middle-school pupils were followed over a 3-year p     20 eriod. Those who viewed their teachers as warm and as providing helpful learning conditions—by making expectations clear and checking that the child understood—worked harder on assignments and participated more in class. Eort and parti     20 cipation, in turn, predicted better academic performance, which sustained the child’s willingness to try hard in the future. In contrast, children who regarded their teachers as unsupportive were more likely to disengage, stop trying,      20 and show declines in achievement. These negative outcomes led children to doubt their own ability, which perpetuated their reduced eort.12
     21 How can adults build interdependent relationships with children that foster the development of culturally meaningful skills and mature, autonomous behavior? To answer this question, Vygotsky proposed a special concept: the zone of prox     21 imal development. Keeping it in mind can help parents and teachers interact with children in ways that lead their development forward. 
     22 
     23 
     24 the zone of proximal development
     25 
     26 Take a few moments to list ﬁve or six competencies of a child you know well. If you are a parent, do so for your own child; if you are a teacher, choose a child in your class. Perhaps your list looks much like this one, recorded by Jes     26 sica, mother of 3-year-old Tyrone: 
     27 
     28 Just learned to cut paper with scissors.
     29 Counts to four.
     30 Looks at picture books and names many pictures.
     31 Remembered two of the animals we saw at the zoo last Sunday. 
     32 Puts together puzzles with eight pieces.
     33 Can sort shapes into categories.
     34 Now indicate whether the skills on your list are ones that the child can do by himself, or whether they are ones that the child displays only when assisted by another person. Jessica, like most parents and teachers completing this exer     34 cise, limited her list to Tyrone’s already acquired abilities—ones he can do alone. 
     35 Vygotsky pointed out that we are used to thinking of the child’s capacities in static or “fossilized” terms—as ﬁnished achievements. In doing so, we look toward the past. What we should do, he advised, is to move beyond what children c     35 an do by themselves to what they can do with expert assistance and, therefore, have the potential to learn. In this way, we focus on the future—on the cognitive processes of today or tomorrow rather than those of yesterday, which are a     35 lready mastered.13 
     36 Vygotsky deﬁned the zone of proximal development as the distance between the child’s actual development (the tasks the child can do individually) and the child’s potential development, “determined through problem solving under adult gu     36 idance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”14 The “zone,” as I’ll call it from now on, is the dynamic region in which new capacities form as children tackle culturally meaningful tasks with a mentor’s assistance. Had Jessica b     36 een thinking about Tyrone’s “zone,” she might have framed the items on her list this way:

      5 In my three decades of teaching university courses in child development, I have come to know thousands of students, many of whom were parents or who became parents soon after completing my class. I also served on boards of directors an      5 d advisory committees for child-care centers, preschools, elementary schools, and parent organizations. And my research continually drew me into classrooms, where for countless hours I observed and recorded preschool and school-age chi      5 ldren’s activities, social interactions, and solitary behaviors, in hopes of answering central questions about how they learn.
      6 As a byproduct of those experiences, parents repeatedly approached me with concerns about how to foster their child’s development in the early years. Their fervent questions, at times riddled with doubt and anxiety, revealed that creat      6 ing optimum learning environments for young children at home—and ensuring their access to development-enhancing experiences in child care, preschool, and school—have become mounting parental challenges. 
      7 Consider the following problematic situations that parents recently raised with me:
      8 
      9 •Bob and Sharon, parents of a 4-year-old: Our daughter, Lydia, could recite her ABCs and count from 1 to 20 by age 2 1/2. When we looked for a preschool, many programs appeared to do little more than let children play, so we chose one       9 with lots of emphasis on academics. To me, Lydia’s preschool seems like great preparation for kindergarten and ﬁrst grade, but each morning, Lydia hates to go. Why is Lydia, who’s always been an upbeat, curious child, so unhappy?
     10 •Angela, mother of a 4-year-old and 6-year-old: My husband and I have demanding careers and need to bring work home in the evenings. I’ve read that it’s the quality of time we spend with our children that’s important, not the quantity.     10  We try hard to give Victor and Jeannine our undivided attention, but they’re often whiny, demanding, and quarrelsome. Many times we end up sending them to their rooms or letting them watch TV, just to get some peace after a long day.      10 What’s the best way to create quality parent–child time?
     11 •Talia, mother of a 7-year-old: My son Anselmo, a ﬁrst grader, constantly asks us to help him with his homework. His father ﬁrmly insists that he do it by himself. Anselmo tries, but he gets so frustrated and upset that I move in and h     11 elp, even in the face of opposition from his dad. By that time, Anselmo is on such a short string that I do most of the assignment for him. Should we be helping Anselmo with his homework and, if so, how?
     12 •Noah and Suzanne, parents of a 2-year-old: When our parents were raising us, they seemed conﬁdent of their power and inﬂuence. Recently we read that how children turn out is mostly written in their genes; there’s little we as parents      12 can do about it. Does parenting really matter?rses in child development,     13  I have come to know thousands of students, many of whom were parents or     14  who became parents soon after completing my class. I also served on boa     15 baffled, bewildered parentsry committees for child-care centers, prescho     16 ols, elementary schools, and parent organizations. And my research conti     17 Despite being well educated, intent on doing what’s best for their children, and enlightened by a vast literature of child-rearing advice, many American parents appear uneasy and unsure of their roles at best, baed and bewildered at wo     17 rst. As the above sampling of concerns reveals, today’s parents are not just worried about major transitions and traumas, such as the impact of marital breakup or community violence. They agonize over commonplace, recurrent, everyday s     17 ituations—whether intensive preschool academic tutoring is crucial for later success in school, the meaning of “quality time” with children, and whether and how to help their child with homework. At an even more fundamental level, cont     17 emporary parents have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their children’s development. Why is this so?
     18 The reasons, I believe, are twofold. First, rapid societal changes have complicated parents’ task, making child rearing more challenging than in previous generations. Second, information about child development disseminated to parents      18 is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictory. It fails to oer a clear, consistent vision of good child rearing to guide daily decision making and practice. Let’s take a closer look at these sources of parental frustrat     18 ion and confusion.  questions, at times riddled with doubt and anxiety,      19 revealed that creating optimum learning environments for young children      20 Societal Changesring their access to development-enhancing experiences i     21 n child care, preschool, and school—have become mounting parental challe     22 Over the past three decades, external forces impinging on the family have transformed parents’ and, therefore, children’s lives. Overall, parents complain that they have less free time to spend with their children.1 Witness a 1995 surv     22 ey of a large, representative sample of American workers, nearly 25 percent of whom expressed the feeling that the demands of their jobs left them with “no time for family.”2 Compounding their worries, employed parents must, out of nec     22 essity, turn over many hours of child rearing to other adults. Yet once their children are beyond their grasp, they are hardly o the hook! Conscientious parents face an added responsibility: monitoring their child’s whereabouts and act     22 ivities, verifying from a distance that their youngster is physically safe, emotionally contented, and constructively engaged. 
     23 Although many societal conditions heighten parents’ struggle to rear psychologically healthy children, two are especially pernicious, aecting even parents who manage to escape the trials and tribulations of divorce, single parenthood,      23 stepchildren, serious ﬁnancial worries, and other family stresses. The ﬁrst is the dire shortage of acceptable child-care options in the United States, the second is the parental dilemma of “never enough time.” In view of these diculti     23 es, it is little wonder that so many American parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their children’s development. 
     24 
     25 the problem of child care.  In 1970, 30 percent of mothers with pre-school children were in the labor force, a ﬁgure that increased more than twofold, to 62 percent, by 2000.3 An obvious solution to reconciling parents’ employment need     25 s with young children’s rearing needs is to make high-quality, nonparental care, with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development, widely available and aordable. In Australia and Western Europe, child care is nat     25 ionally regulated and liberally funded to ensure that it conforms to standards veriﬁed by research to foster children’s learning, social competence, and emotional security.4 
     26 Without a nationally regulated and generously subsidized child-care system, formal child care in the United States is in much shorter supply and considerably more costly for parents than it is in other industrialized nations. And as ou     26 r discussion in Chapter 6 will reveal, on the whole, the quality of American child care—whether center-based or home-based—is mediocre to abysmal.5 Indeed, so widespread is poor-quality child care in the United States that Americans ha     26 ve acclimated to it. In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen child-care centers across four states, over 90 percent believed that their preschoolers’ experiences were far better tha     26 n experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be.6 Parents seemed unable to distinguish “good” from “substandard” care. 
     27 
     28 the “time bind.”  Like many parents, Angela, who raised the question of quality time, complains of being “torn in many directions.” Often she leaves work in a hurry in the late afternoon to pick up Victor and Jeannine from child care,      28 dashes to Victor’s tumbling class or Jeannine’s piano lesson, then stops at the grocery store to pick up something for dinner. When Angela and her husband, Tom, walk through their front door, they typically head to the phone or fax mac     28 hine to take care of unﬁnished work while trying to quell Victor and Jeannine’s hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set. Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job, m     28 arriage, and parenting, Angela and Tom feel drained at the end of the day—too tired to grant their children more than 10 or 15 minutes of focused time. When Victor and Jeannine do get their parents’ undivided attention, they are argume     28 ntative and unruly, compounding their parents’ fatigue and impatience. 
     29 Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules, much like a business appointment. They love their children, but they also love and need their work, for personal and ﬁnancial     29  reasons. Hence they ﬁnd themselves in a juggling act between the two, with work usually winning out. Tomorrow will be another day for the kids, they rationalize, but a business deal or a professional achievement, if not capitalized on     29  at the moment, may evaporate. Their logic dovetails with the concept of “quality time” for children. In its commonly accepted meaning, quality time refers to an intense but brief contact. The term is a ready salve for the consciences      29 of conﬂicted parents, who squeeze in a few moments with their children, catch-as-catch-can, yet sense deep down that they are robbing their youngsters—and themselves—of something vital.
     30 The expression “quality time” dates back to the 1970s, a decade that witnessed the largest rise in women’s participation in the labor force during this century. The notion was bolstered by observational studies of parent–child interact     30 ion. In these investigations, some parents exchanged positive emotional signals with and verbally stimulated their infants, and read to and conversed with their preschoolers. Other parents spent time with their children but were not ac     30 tively engaged with them.

Anselmo tries, but he gets so frustrated and upset that I move in and help, even in the face of opposition from his dad. By that time, Anselmo is on such a short string that I do most of the assignment for him. Should we be helping Anselmo with his homework and, if so, how?

baffled, bewildered parents

Despite being well educated, intent on doing what’s best for their children, and enlightened by a vast literature of child-rearing advice, many American parents appear uneasy and unsure of their roles at best, baed and bewildered at worst. As the above sampling of concerns reveals, today’s parents are not just worried about major transitions and traumas, such as the impact of marital breakup or community violence. They agonize over commonplace, recurrent, everyday situations—whether intensive preschool academic tutoring is crucial for later success in school, the meaning of “quality time” with children, and whether and how to help their child with homework. At an even more fundamental level, contemporary parents have begun to doubt their own ecacy in their children’s development. Why is this so?
The reasons, I believe, are twofold. First, rapid societal changes have complicated parents’ task, making child rearing more challenging than in previous generations. Second, information about child development disseminated to parents is increasingly voluminous but at the same time contradictory. It fails to oer a clear, consistent vision of good child rearing to guide daily decision making and practice. Let’s take a closer look at these sources of parental frustration and confusion. 

Societal Changes

Over the past three decades, external forces impinging on the family have transformed parents’ and, therefore, children’s lives. Overall, parents complain that they have less free time to spend with their children.1 Witness a 1995 survey of a large, representative sample of American workers, nearly 25 percent of whom expressed the feeling that the demands of their jobs left them with “no time for family.”2 Compounding their worries, employed parents must, out of necessity, turn over many hours of child rearing to other adults. Yet once their children are beyond their grasp, they are hardly o the hook! Conscientious parents face an added responsibility: monitoring their child’s whereabouts and activities, verifying from a distance that their youngster is physically safe, emotionally contented, and constructively engaged. 
Although many societal conditions heighten parents’ struggle to rear psychologically healthy children, two are especially pernicious, aecting even parents who manage to escape the trials and tribulations of divorce, single parenthood, stepchildren, serious ﬁnancial worries, and other family stresses. The ﬁrst is the dire shortage of acceptable child-care options in the United States, the second is the parental dilemma of “never enough time.” In view of these diculties, it is little wonder that so many American parents express a sense of powerlessness and inadequacy when it comes to aecting their children’s development. 

the problem of child care.  In 1970, 30 percent of mothers with pre-school children were in the labor force, a ﬁgure that increased more than twofold, to 62 percent, by 2000.3 An obvious solution to reconciling parents’ employment needs with young children’s rearing needs is to make high-quality, nonparental care, with characteristics known to promote healthy psychological development, widely available and aordable. In Australia and Western Europe, child care is nationally regulated and liberally funded to ensure that it conforms to standards veriﬁed by research to foster children’s learning, social competence, and emotional security.4 
Without a nationally regulated and generously subsidized child-care system, formal child care in the United States is in much shorter supply and considerably more costly for parents than it is in other industrialized nations. And as our discussion in Chapter 6 will reveal, on the whole, the quality of American child care—whether center-based or home-based—is mediocre to abysmal.5 Indeed, so widespread is poor-quality child care in the United States that Americans have acclimated to it. In a recent survey of parents whose children were enrolled in several hundred randomly chosen child-care centers across four states, over 90 percent believed that their preschoolers’ experiences were far better than experts in early childhood development judged those experiences to be.6 Parents seemed unable to distinguish “good” from “substandard” care. 

the “time bind.”  Like many parents, Angela, who raised the question of quality time, complains of being “torn in many directions.” Often she leaves work in a hurry in the late afternoon to pick up Victor and Jeannine from child care, dashes to Victor’s tumbling class or Jeannine’s piano lesson, then stops at the grocery store to pick up something for dinner. When Angela and her husband, Tom, walk through their front door, they typically head to the phone or fax machine to take care of unﬁnished work while trying to quell Victor and Jeannine’s hunger and irritability with a frozen dinner popped into the microwave and unlimited access to the TV set. Caught in a ceaseless sprint to reconcile job, marriage, and parenting, Angela and Tom feel drained at the end of the day—too tired to grant their children more than 10 or 15 minutes of focused time. When Victor and Jeannine do get their parents’ undivided attention, they are argumentative and unruly, compounding their parents’ fatigue and impatience. 
Angela and Tom represent a growing number of American parents who try to pencil children into busy schedules, much like a business appointment. They love their children, but they also love and need their work, for personal and ﬁnancial reasons. Hence they ﬁnd themselves in a juggling act between the two, with work usually winning out. Tomorrow will be another day for the kids, they rationalize, but a business deal or a professional achievement, if not capitalized on at the moment, may evaporate. Their logic dovetails with the concept of “quality time” for children. In its commonly accepted meaning, quality time refers to an intense but brief contact. The term is a ready salve for the consciences of conﬂicted parents, who squeeze in a few moments with their children, catch-as-catch-can, yet sense deep down that they are robbing their youngsters—and themselves—of something vital.
The expression “quality time” dates back to the 1970s, a decade that witnessed the largest rise in women’s participation in the labor force during this century. The notion was bolstered by observational studies of parent–child interaction. In these investigations, some parents exchanged positive emotional signals with and verbally stimulated their infants, and read to and conversed with their preschoolers. Other parents spent time with their children but were not actively engaged with them. Time and time again, children of the first set of parents developed more favorably, cognitively and socially, than did children of the second set of parents.7
A close look at the research reveals that children who fared well experienced eective interaction over an extended period. In studies following children from infancy into childhood and adolescence, early brief episodes of parental stimulation and sensitivity did not result in more competent children.8 Instead, positive, supportive parenting that endured, even when it marked a change from an early period of parental retreat or negative interaction, was linked to favorable child development, including persistence in problem solving, high self-esteem, socially skilled behavior, closer friendships, and better peer relationships.9 In sum, high-quality involvement with children requires a certain quantity of time—actually, a great deal, as I’ll argue in this book.
In Angela and Tom’s case, sandwiching concentrated time with Victor and Jeannine between work and other obligations, which often took precedence over family rituals, meant that routines that signal parental caring and that are major sources of development went by the wayside. For example, family dinnertimes and storybook reading at bedtime became rare events. So did the sheer enjoyment that comes from relaxed parent–child play; a joint cooking, art, or construction project; and a conversation based on real listening and exchange of ideas. Because these experiences were so few and short-lived, Angela and Tom were deprived of valuable opportunities to observe their children closely and to become intimately familiar with their talents, shortcomings, preferences, styles of learning, and ways of coping with hardship—knowledge that is crucial for helping children develop into mature, competent individuals.
Furthermore, the “time bind” stiﬂes an essential child-rearing responsibility that I mentioned earlier and will return to again: monitoring children’s experiences while they are both within and beyond parents’ immediate reach. This includes frequently touching base with nonparental caregivers and teachers to ﬁnd out what’s happening at child care or in the classroom; looking in on sibling and peer interaction to make sure that it is positive and respectful; and controlling time spent watching TV and playing video games.
In a recent provocative study, sociologist Arlie Hochschild spent months getting to know employees at a large Midwestern corporation she called Americo. Whether clerical workers or executives, the majority conﬁrmed the parental state of mind just described: They complained of overly long workdays and frenetic home lives. A surprising ﬁnding, however, was that few Americo workers had taken steps to make work and family more compatible. For example, even well-paid employees were not taking the annual six weeks of federally guaranteed, unpaid family leave time, although they could aord to do so. Nor were they asking for job share or ﬂextime, prominent company policies aimed at increasing the compatibility of work and home. Hochschild concludes, “Many working families are both prisoners and architects of the time bind in which they ﬁnd themselves.”10 
As homes become frenzied places in which work encroaches on family time and parents are too exhausted or preoccupied to be physically and psychologically available, children quickly become discipline problems. Their disagreeable behavior often causes parents to retreat further into the haven of work. On the job, such parents feel competent and gratiﬁed; home has turned into a place where they are harried, annoyed, and must deal with children who sulk, complain, plead for gifts, and are obstinate until they get their way—reactions that cry out, “Fifteen minutes, here or there, with an essentially distracted parent, is not enough.”
Fortunately, not all reports are as disturbing as Hochschild’s. Psychologist Rosalind Barnett and journalist Caryl Rivers conducted extensive interviews with 300 dual-earner couples in the Boston area and found that despite stress at work and at home, most were highly satisﬁed and found child rearing to be both manageable and pleasurable.11 And in a survey of 6,000 employees at DuPont, nearly half—and only slightly more women than men—turned down upward career moves to remain in jobs that allowed for more family commitment.12 Barnett believes that parents most prone to a time bind in which work robs family life are at higher socioeconomic levels—in more pressured jobs that have less clearly deﬁned limits and in which advancement typically depends on superlative performance. Ironically, she notes, economically less well o parents ﬁnd it easier to establish a viable dividing line between workplace and home.13
Although the precise extent of family–work conﬂict in American culture is not clear, its presence and detrimental impact on parent-child interaction and children’s development are well founded. Consider a series of studies that examined length of maternity leave in relation to employed mothers’ psychological well-being and parenting behaviors. Short leaves of 6 weeks or less (the norm in the United States) were linked to maternal anxiety and depression and negative interactions with babies. But longer leaves, of 12 weeks or more, predicted favorable maternal mental health and sensitive, responsive parenting. 14

Here, I used less -p to direct my screen to the first occurence of "Vygotsky" in chapter 2 of Berk.

Vygotsky, who studied and wrote about children’s development in Russia in the early twentieth century, was deeply interested in how interdependency—children’s close ties to their community—can pave the way to competence and autonomy. His sociocultural theory has thoroughly collectivist cultural roots. Vygotsky stressed that children need social interaction and meaningful activities to develop, and he regarded high intrinsic motivation and mature, independent functioning as arising from the support granted by cultural experts as children attempt ever more challenging tasks. The child’s mind, Vygotsky pointed out, “extends beyond the skin” and is inseparably joined with other minds. Out of this interconnection springs mastery, proﬁciency, and self-conﬁdence.6
Nevertheless, a deeply ingrained American belief is that satisfying a young child’s desire for social contact and assistance will be habit forming, leading to a clingy, spoiled youngster. Much evidence veriﬁes that this is not ordinarily so.
Consider the early attachment bond that builds between caregiver and baby during the ﬁrst year of life. By age 6 to 8 months, infants single out their parents and other stable, loving caregivers for expressions of joy and turn to them for comfort when anxious and afraid. An overwhelming consensus of research shows that sensitive caregiving—responding to the baby’s cries for physical care and stimulation promptly, consistently, and appropriately—supports the development of a secure attachment relationship.7 Securely attached infants actively seek contact with and are easily consoled by their familiar, responsive caregiver. Yet such infants are not destined to become immaturely dependent! Rather, by the end of the ﬁrst year, their exploration of the physical world is conﬁdent, persistent, and complex. And they are less likely to cry and more likely to use gestures and words to express their desires than are infants whose parents delayed or failed to respond to their calls for help.8 
Sensitive care builds an interdependent relationship between parent and baby—one in which physical and emotional closeness becomes the context for encouraging more mature behavior. Attachment serves as the springboard for a great many capacities that make their ﬁrst appearance in the second year—self-conﬁdence, compliance and cooperation; awareness of others’ needs and desires, and empathy and sympathy (emotions that enable us to feel for and help others in need).9 But the parent who fails to respond promptly and predictably, intervening only after the baby has become extremely agitated, teaches the infant to rise rapidly to intense distress. The baby has learned that only when he is distraught will the parent reliably come to his aid. As a result, he is more dicult to soothe, to encourage to communicate in ways other than crying, and to guide in acquiring other vital competencies.10
An analogous circumstance exists at older ages, as Anselmo’s interactions with his parents reveal. Jim’s refusal to help Anselmo with his homework, in hopes of instilling independence, is counterproductive. Anselmo’s crying and pleading accelerate, to the point that anxiety prevents him from focusing on the task. Denying Anselmo assistance yields precisely what it was intended to prevent—a dependent, doubting child. As Anselmo’s parents refrain from helping, they fuel his anger and demandingness, and ultimately his sense of helplessness. When Talia ﬁnally responds, she does so out of desperation—to stop Anselmo’s agitated appeals, which are about to escalate beyond control. Consequently, Talia assists inappropriately, by doing the task for him.
Anselmo’s resulting disorganized behavior and dependency prompt additional parental vacillation—sometimes refusals to help, at other times maladaptive helping—along with exasperation and criticism. Talia and Jim can be heard saying impatiently, “You aren’t any good at this!” “Can’t you do anything?”11 Soon a barrier forms between Anselmo and the task he had previously wanted to master, and his motivation wanes.
In classrooms, the same sequence of events prevails. Teachers’ communication plays a vital role in children’s eort and learning. Consider a recent study, in which 1,600 elementary- and middle-school pupils were followed over a 3-year period. Those who viewed their teachers as warm and as providing helpful learning conditions—by making expectations clear and checking that the child understood—worked harder on assignments and participated more in class. Eort and participation, in turn, predicted better academic performance, which sustained the child’s willingness to try hard in the future. In contrast, children who regarded their teachers as unsupportive were more likely to disengage, stop trying, and show declines in achievement. These negative outcomes led children to doubt their own ability, which perpetuated their reduced eort.12
How can adults build interdependent relationships with children that foster the development of culturally meaningful skills and mature, autonomous behavior? To answer this question, Vygotsky proposed a special concept: the zone of proximal development. Keeping it in mind can help parents and teachers interact with children in ways that lead their development forward. 


the zone of proximal development

Take a few moments to list ﬁve or six competencies of a child you know well. If you are a parent, do so for your own child; if you are a teacher, choose a child in your class. Perhaps your list looks much like this one, recorded by Jessica, mother of 3-year-old Tyrone: 

Just learned to cut paper with scissors.
Counts to four.
Looks at picture books and names many pictures.
Remembered two of the animals we saw at the zoo last Sunday. 
Puts together puzzles with eight pieces.
Can sort shapes into categories.
Now indicate whether the skills on your list are ones that the child can do by himself, or whether they are ones that the child displays only when assisted by another person. Jessica, like most parents and teachers completing this exercise, limited her list to Tyrone’s already acquired abilities—ones he can do alone. 
Vygotsky pointed out that we are used to thinking of the child’s capacities in static or “fossilized” terms—as ﬁnished achievements. In doing so, we look toward the past. What we should do, he advised, is to move beyond what children can do by themselves to what they can do with expert assistance and, therefore, have the potential to learn. In this way, we focus on the future—on the cognitive processes of today or tomorrow rather than those of yesterday, which are already mastered.13 
Vygotsky deﬁned the zone of proximal development as the distance between the child’s actual development (the tasks the child can do individually) and the child’s potential development, “determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers.”14 The “zone,” as I’ll call it from now on, is the dynamic region in which new capacities form as children tackle culturally meaningful tasks with a mentor’s assistance. Had Jessica been thinking about Tyrone’s “zone,” she might have framed the items on her list this way: 

Just learned to cut paper with scissors. If I hold the paper while he cuts and prompt him, he can cut along straight or curved lines. He cut out a square and a circle with help today. I asked him which animals we saw at the zoo, and he mentioned girae and zebra. When I reminded him of the bird and pachyderm houses, he remembered a lot more: the ﬂamingos, parrots, swans, elephants, hippos, and rhinos.

For Vygotsky, a crucial aspect of parenting and the central aim of education is to provide children with experiences in their “zone”—activities that challenge them but that can be accomplished with sensitive adult guidance. Consequently, parents and teachers carry much responsibility for ensuring that children’s learning is maximized—for actively leading them along the developmental pathway. Rather than transmitting ready-made knowledge to a passive child or giving a child tasks for which he or she already has the requisite skills, the adult’s role is to engage in dialogue with the child—by observing, conversing, questioning, assisting, and encouraging. During that dialogue, the adult continually assesses the child’s progress and creates the “zone” by keeping the task “proximal”—slightly above the child’s level of independent functioning. In this way, the adult “rouses to life” those cognitive processes that are just emerging in the child,15 sustaining them socially so they can be reﬁned and internalized as part of the child’s psychological world.


creating the “zone”

What features of adult–child shared activity forge the “zone”? Research documents several communicative ingredients that consistently foster development, in children of diverse ages and across a wide range of tasks.

Shared Understanding

For information, ideas, and skills to move from the social-interactive plane to the internal-thinking plane, the adult and child must strive for a common approach to the situation. They must desire genuine communication and work toward attaining it. 
In sociocultural theory, this joint, mutual focus is called intersubjectivity, or shared understanding.16 As the word suggests, each participant in the dialogue strives to grasp the subjective perspective of the other, an eort that results in a “meeting of minds,” in which the partners’ thoughts make contact, connect, and coincide. Intersubjectivity reaches its pinnacle in a love aair, where shared understanding is readily achieved through a glance, a touch, or a comment. Lovers in close psychological contact grasp one another’s meanings quickly because each is on the lookout for and tries to satisfy the other’s needs.17 The opposite of intersubjectivity is total misunderstanding. In a failed love aair, widely divergent views of the same experiences cause people to say, “You don’t understand me. You’ve become a stranger. We can’t ﬁnd common ground. We’ve grown apart.”
The image of lovers communicating helps us appreciate the circumstances in which intersubjectivity is most likely to occur: in close relationships. Children most often attain it with parents, other family members, teachers, and eventually in fch2.txt
